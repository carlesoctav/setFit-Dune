{"id": 0, "title": "Long live the fighters", "content": "Phenomenal stuff. I'll probably calm down tomorrow but right now my heart's beating like crazy and my brain's screaming it's a bloody masterpiece. This is one of the few movies that I didn't try to control my expectations beforehand and it still surpassed them in many ways.\"Power over spice is power over all\"- that kinda turned out to be a lie at the end. As The movie starts, I felt an immediate sense of tension through its score. It's a cinematic experience; I can't imagine feeling the same lying at home in bed, watching in headphones. The resonating vibrations as the sounds reverberate through the theater created an epic atmosphere.When Part One came out people said it was \"game of thrones in space\", I wasn't really taken by that as much, especially since people said the same about Apple TV's Foundation series. So I just enjoyed the movie as Dune and bore no comparisons. After watching part two however I see it; the world building, the politics, the epic grandeur of it all.However, the first half of Dune Part Two is pretty grounded and calm, delving into the lives of the Fremen. It almost feels like two distinct movies, the first half intricately setting the stage for the climactic third act and reinforcing character connections established in Dune Part One. Unlike the Part One's focus on lore, this movie is more devotion-driven, also resembling a political narrative, especially knowing of the hidden puppeteers behind the empire. The result appears to be an intricate web of schemes involving the empire, the witch-advisor women(can't spell their names lol), and the Baron's family. Despite the emperor's pulling the strings, the Baron's family still felt like main antagonist to me.The second half of the movie is where we see the epic scale of dune. The movies not quick paced but you couldn't tell, I was absolutely immersed in it.I absolutely loved the kind \"The mahdi is too humble to say he is the mahdi.\" Theatre burst out in laughter. It felt weird, I wasn't expecting any humour. It's funnier than I expected. More lively than the first Dune movie. I'd already seen the Usul-worm-riding scene from the Dune Part One reopening bonus content. I was still just as excited and it didn't spoil a thing.The visual brilliance, as expected was stunning, elevating every aspect. The authenticity of the scenes made it feel as if characters were immersed in the environment, rather than merely placed against a green screen. I loved the portrayal of time passing through Paul's changing eyes; the longer he stays the bluer his eyes get. Despite how lively it is, the plot, while progressing at a measured pace, remains engaging, drawing attention away from its deliberate slowness. It has much more action, the battles were absolutely epic, I feel like they could have been longer but they still captivated me.Jessica disappears for a while, but just when I thought that, she showed up. Other than Paul and Zendeya, the rest of the cast doesn't really get as much screen time as you'd think. I loved the baby/embryo/featus scenes. Batista with no mask in the desert while his whole team's suited up was badass. I love him in darker roles, although I think some moments felt overly animated. But it gave an effective contrast to Austin Butler though, I couldn't wait to see what his character was like. Very fierce, intimidating and psycho. The girl shivering with the plate in her hands before the gladiator games made me chuckle. Butler did also sound like the baron at times.Dune: Part Two stands steady on its own, it felt complete compared to the more introductory feel of Part One. Despite this, I still felt like it lays groundwork for Dune: Part Three/Messiah, leaving a sense of setup. The movie, while feeling like a precursor, still manages to provide a more conclusive ending. I also think you should watch Part One first, if that has to be said; and the prospect of a back-to-back viewing sounds like a fun afternoon.One thing I can complain about is Stilger. I have mixed feelings. In Part One, Javier was fierce and was my favorite character, in this movie though he's depicted as a religious fanatic for the most part. It was done well, but I still miss the Stilgar who walked up to Duke Leto Atreides with no disregard. This felt like a different person, still fierce, just different.Loved Austin butler though, I wasn't sure what to expect as I tried my best to avoid trailers and teasers apart from the Dune part one bonus content. That short lady in charge of extracting 'the water of life' had some insane calves on her, I'm extremely jealous.While I was initially not convinced about Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet as the lead, he truly owns the role in the sequel, displayed acting facets I'd not seen before from him. The movie essentially unfolds as Paul Atreides' coming-of-age story, with Zendaya delivering an amazing performance. The first act, focusing on their love story, adds depth to the events at the movie's end. Zendaya's portrayal transcends the typical love story, I hope her role extends into Dune: Messiah, and hopefully adds further complexity to her character.We see Paul undergo some transformations. From being the son of royalty to experiencing love, the narrative takes a surprising turn when he assumes authority in the third act. Although I liked it, it felt a bit rushed. But, I found solace/logic with the \"water of life\" spiritual poison, where drinking it resulted in a profound shift in your personality. The contrast between the before and after versions of Paul, as well as Jessica, is striking so it kinda made sense to me.I think watching this movie at home won't do it justice, it's clearly made for the big screens if you can. It's pretty epic and I think it'll remain memorable as one of 2024's best movies, despite only being February. I absolutely loved it.", "rating": 9, "sentiment": 1, "date": "26 February 2024", "name": "AfricanBro"}

Would highly recommend to re-watch the first movie in order to appreciate the subtleties and foreshadowing better, though it's not completely necessary since the movie is pretty self-contained and would please general audience that only watched the first movie 3 years ago just as well.Denis Villeneuve continues to prove himself as one of the most promising filmmakers of our time, and if it was up to me I would keep him in these high-budget epic tales such as these since there are very few directors working today that can tackle this genre as good as he does.In my personal opinion, the movie is better than the first part in pretty much every aspect. Hans Zimmer's score is masterful just as you'd expect, and one step up from the Oscar winner and Grammy nominated score of Pt. 1. Technical aspects such as VFX, Production Design, Sound, Editing, etc. Are all top notch and awards-worthy. The action sequences are absolutely mind blowing and sent chills down my spine. Denis direction is impeccable, and the story is absolutely fascinating- continuing to develop characters from Pt. 1 even deeper and introduce new incredible and intriguing characters.The movie serves as a great wrap-up to the story introduced in Pt. 1 however in my opinion could serve as an even better set-up to a possible masterpiece in Dune: Messiah, which I really hope will get green-lit soon.I believe (and surely hope) this movie will be a major player in the next Award Season. Below-the-line wins are pretty much guaranteed as of now, but I hope it will get some love in above-the-line categories such as Direction and even Best Picture, perhaps to break stigmas presented against the Fantasy/Sci-Fi genre in recent years at the Academy. As a big fan of the genre, unless a better competitor will be released later this eligibility period, maybe it's time for a movie like this to triumph once again.Don't miss the opportunity to catch this movie on IMAX, since I believe it's an historic piece of epic-Fantasy/Sci-Fi cinema and a movie that will be remembered as a classic of the genre.Extremely recommended.", "rating": 10, "sentiment": 1, "date": "26 February 2024", "name": "Dvir971"}

But things go according to his vision and he becomes a morally complex character. Religious fantacism takes hold of the fremen.It is up for interpretation what kind of character Paul becomes. Is he a tyrant? Was it the only path? What does religion have to do with it? Paul takes hold of the Bene Gesserit lie by exploiting faith.This leads to other questions. Can one truly trust the arm of flesh? The frailty of man? Leaders have come and gone throughout history bringing different ideals.One's own morality comes into play. Agency is vital to the human experience. Man will always falter. This leads to questions of a higher power and His role. Is there a God above? What are the implications of that?We don't get stories like this in Hollywood anymore. There is no happy ending in Dune, and one can only ponder the moral complexities of it. The book and movie have made me contemplate many things and I deeply appreciate stories like that.Others have already applauded the effects, acting and script, so I won't go into that too much here.

I wasn't familiar with the story and I went with zero expectations, only to be completely stunned by the masterful artwork that was Dune Part 1.The music, the sound, the visuals, the entire world and its atmosphere, the characters even the plot, I found everything beautifully crafted and a breath of fresh air for the Sci-Fi genre.I am not familiar with the source material so this is considering only the movies and while I had a deep desire to love this second part specially considering the reviews it has been getting and how much I loved the first one, I couldn't help but feel a slight disappointment...\nLet's start with the positives - the cinematography is consistently out of this world, it is a visual wonder, a mix of practical effects with CGI that blends in perfectly. The intense and dramatic sound effects associated with a thrilling and daunting soundtrack delivers! And of course the acting is consistently good, this time around it was great to see Javier Barden's character being developed and bringing some great topics to the table.What makes me wonder the most to be honest is how different both the first movie and the second are being reviewed by the general public..\nFor once its running time is considerable (almost 3 hours) and somehow it feels strangely rushed... It's a bit odd to explain but in other words, we get so many scenes that feel that don't contribute at all to the narrative and out of the blue we transition to a scene where the main character changes the demeanor entirely without much build up leading to it..\nThe movie spends so much time trying to connect Paul to the Fremens, yet it fails to explore his own inner motivations, the moment we see his character changing, it gives you the feeling that you missed something.Paul's betrayal to Chani also feels a bit irrelevant since the chemistry built on the first movie seems to just dissipate...\nThe relationship with his mother is also very odd and inconsistent, her character becomes dark fairly early in the movie, in one moment she is her beloved mother and without much shared screen time he then seems to almost despise her by the end of the film without the audience having a deeper understanding of their relationship dynamic.The newly introduced villains are one dimensional and having Austin Butler's character seemed pointless... there was no goal for him, he gets killed off almost instantly alongside with the Baron who got so much build from the first movie...\nAn A list of actors like Florence Pugh, Christopher Walken and L\u00e9a Seydoux, all of them could've been amazing characters but get zero chance of showing that.An entire plot with Paul's sister goes out the drain as well... messing with time started to become promising but it leads nowhere... I mean I could go on, in short the movie had many plot gaps, didn't develop the characters properly, poorly introduced the newcomers and relied heavily on its outstanding cinematography and sound.It's a shame because I can't tell you how excited I was to write a praising review, but this was my honest opinion which apparently doesn't seem to align with the majority.A lot of scenes drag without much substance to it, the highlight of the film was Javier Barden's character and the messages behind the dangerous of the concept of a Messia.I am of course hopeful for the third movie, maybe with my expectations now lowered it becomes a great experience all over again.", "rating": 7, "sentiment": 1, "date": "7 March 2024", "name": "thePopcornExplorer"}

The arena fight between Austin Butler and the last Atreides Robert Yuan (actors names) was fantastic. The battles with the harvesters were phenomenal.The script, however, left me a little bit disappointed. What about the Guild Navigators? And how were the worms used after they came through the pass in the mountains opened up by the atomics? There was only one sequence of the initial charge (marvelous sequence when the gunships entered) but then nothing. The Sardurkar were not given enough respect in this film. There was only one scene that showed them respect and that was when they rose up from the fallen sand and rock debris and stood their ground preparing for the oncoming onslaught instead of panicking. Other than that I felt the film should have spent more time on tactical combat scenes in what was supposed to be an epic battle at the end of the film, maybe trim time off of the other dragged out sequences in the film. The first movie did a better job with the Sardaukar, you actually feared them. The epic battle at the end of this movie was less than epic. And poor Bautista, they should not have made him act like such a wimp, should have had a more glorious fight even in retreat.As much as I like Walken, I thought he was poorly cast to be Emperor. The 1984 film had a perfect actor for the personality. This is Villeneuve's fault, he picked him.The script also fails to emphasize that Paul is the Kwisatz Haderach at the end of the movie. Paul's initial ability to vaguely see the future comes from the centuries of genetic tinkering of the women of the Ben Gesserat, but after he drinks the water of life and not only survives but develops the ability to see an individual's past, as evident by the scenes in the Fremen temple where he looks at individuals and describes their past, and more clearly sees optional future outcomes, and after he actually fulfills all of the prophecies of the Fremen, the story is true, he really is the Messiah of Arrakis, justifying the religion, and he really is the Kwisatz Haderach, a man with abilities that no other man has. But the film appears to gloss over this. Shame. He is not just some populist charismatic man blamed by the likes of Zendaya's character for (perceived) fooling anyone to follow him and falling for the appeal of power and giving up his principles, he is more than that.My critique of the first film was not enough emotion, well part 2 does a better job, especially after Paul survives the water of life and becomes the anti-hero, all hell breaks loose. And Zendaya's character being a more independent women than the 1984 film was interesting, albeit the combat skills or luck were not realistic unless you buy that the Sardaukar were that inept. Part 1 was a better drama than part 2, but part 2 has some great action sequences, besides the disappointments I mentioned earlier.

{"id": 14, "title": "A Masterpiece", "content": "Frank Herbert's Dune is widely considered to be some of the most challenging science fiction material to adapt to the big screen. In 2021, Villeneuve hit it out of the park with Dune - Part One. In Part Two, he outdoes himself in every way. From cinematography to music to choreography to acting and dialogue, this movie had a mountain to climb to prove itself, and it did.With Hans Zimmer composing the score, it should surprise no one how well it compliments the film. Greig Fraser (Dune - Part One, The Creator, The Batman) was at the helm of cinematography, and really took my breath away with the magnificent vistas, incredible use of colours and even infrared, and expert capture of motion and scale. Fraser explains that they shot in digital, transposed to 35mm, then back to digital. This seemed absurd to me, until he explained that digital appeared too crisp for audiences, and film too nostalgic. His method obtained the perfect balance. I can't fault him for that, because I agree.The real risk here is of course the adaptation. How to retain some of the richest and most beloved science fiction lore in existence and condense it into the 2 hours and 46 minutes runtime. Villeneuve took a huge risk by splitting the first book into two parts. Had studios not green-lit part two, we would have been left with half a book. Unsatisfying for everyone. Thankfully the gamble paid off, and he was able to tell the epic story across two movies bordering on three hours. Even this required a brisk pace, with many notable scenes omitted. Despite this, I think Villeneuve retained the heart and soul of the story. He created two movies which appeal to both general audiences, and fans alike.

Over the course of the story, he changes from a likable kid into something more cosmic and inhuman, and that might be a problem for the audience, since stories usually need a relatable character. Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet manages this transition skillfully and believably but it still leaves the audience without their relatable character.Villeneuve seems to have hit on an ideal solution: beef up the role of Chani so that she becomes that relatable character. I can already envision her role in the third movie of the trilogy, which no doubt is already being planned given the huge box office success of this movie.This is a big departure from the books but the third movie is going to have to be more of Villeneuve's invention that the first two were, anyway.\n                \n                    6 out of 6 found this helpful.\n                        \n                            Was this review helpful?

{"id": 21, "title": "Spectacle", "content": "Denis Villeneuve's second half of his adaptation of Frank Herbert's Dune fully embraces the spectacle inherent in the material while also digging into the core implications that Herbert was exploring around power, cults of personality, and leadership. He flips some things around (I'm pretty sure), but otherwise delivers a handsome, exciting, second half to what he had started. And then he highlights Chani way too much, changing her character so much that she sticks out like a sore thumb to curious purposes that do little more than distract from what's going on around her. Seriously, if the final twenty seconds of this film were chopped off and lost in a fire, I'd actually be a good bit more positive on the film.Paul Atreides (Timothee Chalamet) and his mother the Lady Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson) have joined the Fremen led by Stilgar (Javier Barden). Paul grows close to Chani (Zendaya) who helps teach him the ways of the desert as they go into hiding from the dominant Harkonnen led by the Baron (Stellan Skarsgard), his elder nephew Rabban (Dave Bautista) left as governor of the desert planet Arrakis while the Baron continues to groom his younger nephew Feyd (Austin Butler) towards leadership. Operating as an exposition dump for those who didn't remember the first film is Irulan (Florence Pugh), nominally taking up her chronicling duties from the book (her entries marking the start of every chapter), while her father, the Emperor Shaddam IV (Christopher Walken), quietly ruminates on the implications of his plan to eradicate the Atreides perhaps failing.This is one of those stories that I know so well, that I kind of assume that everyone knows. And yet, Dune, for all it's popularity among scifi nerds, isn't the grand cultural touchpoint it's sometimes made out to be. Its influences are strong and wide, but the actual story knowledge isn't.Anyway, now's the time to talk about some creative choices. The first that screams out to me is how much more stylized visually the film is. The film opens with a scene of Harkonnen troops attacking the Fremen in the desert, and Villeneuve uses a partial eclipse as an excuse to bathe the entire scene in a deep orange. It's really nice to look at. I've been curious about the black and white segments in the trailers since I've seen them, and the explanation is that Geidi Prime has a black sun making it so that outside just looks like that. Knowing more from the books, I'd say that the whole Harkonnen look is something I'd attribute more to the Bene Tlielax, but it's at least interesting to see.There's a heavy emphasis on the Bene Gesserit and their breeding program in here, which I appreciate. I think that most heavily gets highlighted in the inclusion of Lady Margot Fenring (Lea Seydoux), a Bene Gesserit sent to Geidi Prime to seduce Feyd, secure his bloodline, and learn how to manipulate him should certain probabilities arise. She is very briefly seen in a modified form in the Sci-Fi Channel series, but otherwise she's never made an appearance in an adaptation. Although, unless Villeneuve is planning on using material from the sequel novels written by Brian Herbert (please no), Lady Fenring shouldn't be making any more appearances, making this feel like something of a dead end that still manages to provide some nice detail in terms of worldbuilding.And that leads me to the editing. I like how much detail gets brought in to help fill out the world (universe) of Dune, but there are some places where the film feels too fast. Take, for instance, the jump from Paul and Chani sitting on a dune watching a wormrider in the distance, Chani explaining to Paul that he'll never become a rider because he's not really Fremen. Cut ahead to about fifteen minutes later in screentime, there's been no mention of Paul training or anything, and now it's time for Paul to ride his first worm. Time has obviously passed, and this feels like the instance of a cut scene that was deemed unnecessary. However, considering how much time gets dedicated to Fenring's seduction of Feyd, it makes you wonder if the priorities were in total alignment when cutting the film down to its current length.So, Paul stays in the northern parts of Arrakis to lead the small revolt of the Fedaykin fighters against the Harkonnen while Jessica, pregnant and having become the Fremen's Reverend Mother through the changing of the Water of Life from poison into a harmless drink (no orgy in this mostly sexless adaptation), a process that awakens her unborn daughter, Alia, into consciousness. Gonna be honest, Jessica talking to Alia outloud is great. It's just the right kind of funny in this universe. Anyway, Jessica becomes a fanatic in the pursuit of Paul's legend as the Mahdi, the Lisan al-Gaib, the Voice from the Outer World, while Paul resists it. If I remember correctly, this is something of a complete reversal where Paul easily fell into the legend to help him fight while Jessica saw it as something of a survival mechanism, an unfortunate path she had to take to stay alive. I don't mind this change because Furgeson as a madwoman is great to watch.Things escalate. The Emperor must come to Arrakis. There is a showdown, and that showdown is great. It reminded me of the epic ending to James Cameron's Avatar, a movie I have no great love for but which, I cannot deny, has a freaking awesome final act action sequence. Atomics, worms, giant spaceships, it all comes together in an action and special effects extravaganza that Villeneuve manages with aplomb. It's great fun.Now, Chani. Chani is given extra prominence, and I really don't like how they did it. She is one of the Fremen who does not believe in the Lisan al-Gaib, and she sticks to that belief through everything she witnesses. As Paul is presenting all of the signs, as Chani herself is becoming part of the prophecy that she rejects through literal actions, she not only resists, but she fights back against it. It's so out of place, and it goes through to the end of the film. Sure, Herbert having Chani blithely accept that the love of her life is going to marry an imperial princess for power was always a bit thin, but turning the ending of the film into watching her pouting is just wrong.The story of Dune is Paul going from boy to man to leader to godhead. It's not Chani being mad that Paul is going from boy to man to leader to godhead. Ending on her was a mistake.Anyway, it's a spectacle. I think it gets the heart of Herbert's message right. It mixes things up to some degree and to not entirely successful effect. As an adaptation of Dune, I think the Sci-Fi miniseries is probably the best, but as a filmed experience, this is the more exciting and complete of the three attempts.", "rating": 7, "sentiment": 1, "date": "1 March 2024", "name": "davidmvining"}

It is a masterpiece in terms of visuals, stage designs, use of sound, acting, and the subtext it adapts from the book. It is perhaps the best movie that Hollywood has offered us in recent years, made by the most qualified people. But there is some flaws, even though the voices of people trying to say it are silenced due to the hype that is raging around. Still, I can also say that it is the most deserved hype I have ever seen.The film has two major issue that are related to each other. The first is that the ending of the film is rushed, as if the budget or screen time has run out. The film moves like it jumps from scene to scene without allowing us to enjoy the final climax moment. Thus, the scary sardaukar we saw in the first movie become meaningless. It's a bit like the last season of Game of Thrones here, there is a pacing problem. Honestly, I suspect this feeling was because I was so enthused by the quality of the film at the end so I went crazy for seeing more and more.The second problem is Alia. I understand the difficulty of staging Alia. That's why it was decided to deviate from the book and keep her in the mother's womb throughout the movie. This is a reference that spoils the pacing aspect of the movie, which is smooth except for the last act. While what we see from Paul's and Jessica's experiences is meaningful if it is spread over timeline, this reference point forces it all to have happened in five or six months.It's a problem that shouldn't even be mentioned, but the fact that the Fremen's battle uniforms did not resemble Paul's visions in the first movie made me a little bitter.Dune is a masterpiece in many senses, especially cinematographically. In fact, what the source story says about people, its subtexts and world fiction are amazing. I haven't been this completely immersed in a movie in a long time. I loved how they changed Chani's story arc and gave her a personality, and I loved how they showed Jessica's role more clearly than in the book. I loved how they made the character of Feyd more meaningful as his place in the grand scheme of things.So, it is not free from some flaws. Still, it is such a good movie that, while you normally get bored watching a movie over and over again, I love this movie even more by watching it over and over again.", "rating": 10, "sentiment": 1, "date": "10 March 2024", "name": "averagedeveloper"}

Where in the book his little sister kills the Baron in the film Paul takes the honor of doing so. Also the fact that Chani is not supporting Paul for taking the hand of the Emperor's daughter, didn't have a child with him yet and actually goes her own way makes it hard to get a good start for the inevitable third movie that has to come. As a movie it was a great experience though. The action is great and the storytelling just as well. I personally wished that they sticked to the book till the end.

{"id": 31, "title": "I wish it was better", "content": "I want to love this movie. Despite being in a confused state throughout the film, I enjoyed what I was seeing visually. The lack of dialogue didn't work for me, although it's an aspect that would lessen the more I learned about the characters and world. I just don't get much of a chance at that within the movie. Despite my uninvolvement of the Dune world and its characters, I still have to be honest with the faults of the script and editing.Other than the overarching plot, scenes happen rather than you being lead into scenes via an emotional journey. The first hour is a back and forth of random tests and does she like him or not. Many characters simply appear in the movie, some deep into the runtime, including a main villain who has no discernible traits other than evil for the sake of it. Some characters appear very briefly and don't do much at all. The motivation of everyone was stripped out of the script. We see an abundant amount of screen time on someone riding a worm, but large battles will abrubtly end after very little setup. Did we need a large segment of screen time involving the nukes, when we could've just been told that there's nukes? The nuke scene feels as a standout filler sequence perhaps to be overshadow a few dozen moments of filler that could've been replaced with plot.I would challenge the praisers of this film to explain why everything was perfect. Austin Butler's character was great! Why? Because he was so one dimensional? The battles are the best! You mean snippets of battles that we got and one where it was hard to tell who was who. The score was amazing! Oh, the unbelievably overused bong noise that will randomly appear in the most tepid of scenes? Even the \"twist\" ending was foreshadowed in the first few minutes. This film is all spectacle with no emotional payoff. The number one praise that people will use to describe greatness of Dune 2 is the cinematography. This should be a leg that a great movie stands on, not the foundation. Although the direction and technicality of the look of Dune 2 is epic, the writing and editing are faulty. Maybe upon rewatches I would like it more since I might understand more of the details (after getting those details from other sources), but it's still nowhere as good as it could be or as most everyone seems to think it is.", "rating": 6, "sentiment": 1, "date": "5 March 2024", "name": "movies_are_life_"}

I was a huge science fiction reader when the original novel was published, but I had a great deal of trouble with it. Its texture and density was a bit too much for me in my mid-teens, and previous film versions didn't help much. I was pleased with Villeneuve's film from 2021, because I could finally follow the story without confusion.Part Two - not so much. The narrative is fairly straightforward, but it often felt as if exposition had been omitted. For instance, Lea Seydoux appears in some tight closeups and meaningful dialogue: she plays Lady Margot Fenring. Who? This is presented as a character of significance, a name actress with image and dialogue delivered using film grammar which shouts Significant! Yet we don't know who she is or why she matters, and we never hear from her again.The performances are good, the visuals are great, but again the story proves difficult to convey without confusion.

{"id": 33, "title": "Denis Villeneuve Promises and Delivers", "content": "This movie more than accomplished all of the promises it set out, absolutely mesmerizing experience. I loved the first movie and thought it would be an impossibly difficult task to surpass it, but Denis Villeneuve has once again proven himself as the most promising sci-fi director of this age. I find that this installment of the series picks up its pace quickly and reaches its peak near the end of the film. Contrary to the first film where most of the action was packed into the middle. Dune: Part Two displays a more relaxed tone from the start to the middle of the movie, however the mood shifts to match the occasion and finally leaves you somewhat distraught as the consequences of the character's choices surely lead to a path they cannot return from. The cinematography by Greig Fraser is once again fantastic the mixture of his naturalistic style and the sci-fi genre leads to a grounded universe while still retaining the wonderous and whimsical aspects of science fiction, each decision on how planets and characters are portrayed demonstrates the care and attention paid to how audiences interpret them, you understand the Harkonnen, the Emperor, the Fremen, the Bene Gesserit and the remnants of house Atreides in one look at the way they are shown. The score is once again sublime, Hans Zimmer once again proves himself as the definitive motion picture composer, his ability to craft larger-than-life scores with his ability to understand the differences between each character and culture present in this film is nothing short of perfection, recurring themes and motifs are present throughout the movie and paired with the visuals and the performances, which are also incredible, form a modern day masterpiece crafted meticulously by masters of their respective fields. Rebecca Ferguson, Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet, Javier Bardem, Austin Butler and Zendaya give wonderful performances, with the first three being standouts.

{"id": 35, "title": "Too much hype for this overrated sequel", "content": "I tried not to feel conditioned by the hype around this movie, but I was quite dissapointed after watching it.After a superb part one, which was a magical exhibition of cinema and an aesthetic pleasure, this second part is quite pretentious. Looks like the style exercise of an artist in love with himself, and seems that the story is a secondary factor here.It is like, \"ok, did you like the scenes of the thumper calling the sandworm?, here you have like twenty scenes of a thumper calling sandworms, and even a scene with twenty thumpers calling sandworms at the same time; did you like the beautiful faces of Zendaya and Rebecca Ferguson in the desert, with great Hans Zimmer music?, ok, here you have fifty seven shots of the beautiful faces in dramatic moments of all the extremely pretty actresses we have been able to recruit for this\". The problem is that quantity does not compensate for the loss of the surprise effect.In fact, the story is just an excuse for an interminable exhibition of close-ups of the incredibly beautiful faces of the female cast, no less beautiful desert sceneries, and an interminable succession of sand worm ridings.Flat and hollow aesthetics, with a really poor storytelling. The story is confusing, with a first act focused in the Fremen, but with no real advance of the story, just Fremen in the desert, Fremen worshiping the mesiah, Fremen riding worms, worshiping again, Chani frowning at the inmensity of the desert with deep music, and so on (actually, Chani spent all movie frowning). Actually, the first act was terribly boring.Then, the abuse of ellipsis makes the story rush forward, to the point of losing sense sometimes. It is really difficult to follow it without any previous knowledge of what happened in the original novel.This rush lead to weird situations, as when suddenly Chani shows up out from nowhere in a ornithopter, and you ask yourself why and how she ended flying that thing.The rush to close the story causes the last act to be resolved hastily and sloppily. The expected final battle is resolved very quick and lacking epic and glory. The supposedly powerful and fearsome Sardaukar appears in the last battle as a few random guys without any combat abilities. The formerly powerful emperor and Harkonnen, are now weak and do not stand a chance against the new dark mesiah and their fundamentalist troops.Overall, the movie lost all the magic and mistery of the first part, and it is just an exhibition of style from a director that seems to be more in love with himself than with the story he is telling.About acting, all the cast are doing a great job. Special mention to the superb Javier Bardem, who, together with Zendaya, support all the movie on their shoulders. All the Harkonnen are doing a great job and are the most interesting characters, both in acting and aesthetically. To me, Paul Atreides is the worst part, plain and lacking substance and the you could expect from the leader of a holy war against a galactic empire.In summary, a pretentious sequel larguely inferior to the first part in all aspects.", "rating": 5, "sentiment": 1, "date": "2 March 2024", "name": "sadak7599"}

{"id": 38, "title": "It's Part One once again, only more confused and anticlimactic", "content": "I had great hopes for \"Dune: part two\" since I really liked the first part but I was left a bit disappointed. Once again the technical aspect of the production is phenomenal: everything is very well crafted (direction, cinematography, production design, performances, score) and it is undoubtedly a big part of the film which has to be recognized and that it saves it for me. This is because the narrative part has a lot of issues. If the first movie was still slow paced, it was able to create an imaginary and become iconic, it had the purpose of setting up the second part and I thought some sort of payoff was coming in \"part two\". Instead even the second movie is all setup with a final battle which lasts like 15 minutes and a very rushed and anticlimactic finale. But if the first part took more its time to better justify the characters' actions, this second part doesn't do that (maybe more screen time would have beneficial). Many times characters do things out of nowhere or because the story needs them but their actions doesn't feel earned and justified in most cases. I'm not saying it's all bad and I liked the movie (the rating shows that) but it could have been so much more.The other issue is that this part two in the end is essentially part one but three years later, it has all the same merits and defects. It is technically exceptional and it is surely able to impress and foment. On the flip side they both were not able to make the viewer empathize much with the characters and the worst thing of all: it is once again truncated. I accepted it for the first one because it was a build up and because it was the first part of the book, but here it's bad. I get that there is a sequel coming (in theory) but the story is interrupted once again. I've read comparisons to \"Empire Strikes Back\" because it was the middle part of a trilogy, but the plot of that movie was closed. Indeed the last shot of \"Episode V\" is a clear indication of the closure of the story narrated but opening to the fact that \"something is more to come, the final battle is nearing\". \"Dune: part two\" is instead cut anticlimactically.Unfortunately I'm pretty disappointed by \"Dune: part two\" which was the movie I was expecting the most this year. I liked it but I felt a lot of wasted potential.

{"id": 40, "title": "Hard Not to Compare it to the Book and Feel Disappointed", "content": "I'm going to write this as a review for both Dune movies, so I'll include my thoughts about Dune part one throughout. For me, the most difficult part about rating these movies is trying to judge them as they stand on their own without comparing them to the original book.As movies, I think both are great: the cinematography is amazing, the sound design is good, the acting is good, I liked the visual style and how they interpreted the various technologies of the world of Dune. The soundtrack is good, it can be a little overbearing at times but the music in part two felt like an improvement on this from part one. One of the biggest complaints people had with both movies is the pacing, saying that the first movie was dragging and the second was rushing. I agree with the sentiments about the latter, but personally I enjoyed the slower pacing of the first Dune movie. The second movie definitely moves quickly through its first half, then it slows down a lot in the second half before rushing to its conclusion.The casting is good for the most part, I personally disagree with casting Rebecca Ferguson but I'll get into that more later. In the first movie I wasn't especially impressed with Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet as Paul but I think he does better in the role in the second part. Jason Momoa was a perfect pick for Duncan Idaho and Oscar Isaac did a great job as Duke Leto. Stellan Skarsgard was a good choice for Baron Harkonnen but I think he could have been written better. I was really looking forward to seeing Christopher Walken as the Emperor Shaddam but unfortunately he felt pretty lifeless and didn't bring very much energy to the scenes he was in.Overall, as they stand on their own, the Dune movies are great films. I don't know if I'd call them the defining sci-fi movies of the 21st century like other people are saying, but they're still very good, definitely rewatchable, and I would recommend them.Now, moving on to comparing them to the books, because once you start doing that you get to the more disappointing side of these movies. One of the biggest issues with both movies, especially the second, is that they almost completely leave out the ecological message of the book. This is a book that has been used as a textbook in environmental science classes, but I guess the filmmakers decided that message wasn't important enough. The Fremen are shown to be working towards terraforming Dune into a green world, slowly but surely making wind traps and planting grasses to fix the dunes in place. It's a goal that they are working towards with total commitment even though they know that it won't be realized for several generations. That's a powerful message that I think a lot more people need to hear nowadays, especially in reference to the issue of climate change. The movie barely mentions this goal at all, which I think is a disservice to the original story, and it diminishes the Fremen as characters.I think the fundamental issue that these movies have with their adaptations is an understandable one, but that it could've been solved in a better way. The main issue with adapting the book is that the characters are very difficult to relate to: most of them are superhumans who have insane abilities. For the movies, a lot of the main characters are altered to make them more relatable to the audience, which is an understandable change. For some characters, this greatly improves them from the book, such as Duncan Idaho and Duke Leto. For others, like Chani and Jessica, it reduces the strength of their characters, which I'll explain more later.Additionally, the book has a lot of complex concepts and story plots that it never stops to fully explain to the reader, you're just supposed to pick it up as you go along and reread it to understand, making it a little obtuse. Dune is very dialogue-heavy, with a lot of the action happening in the background or only described briefly. To remedy this, the movies remove some of the more complex topics and add more action scenes, which are exciting and well choreographed, but in the second movie they start feeling repetitive and redundant, and they overpower the more intricate plot points.While the first movie cleverly managed to insert a lot of exposition without feeling like it was constantly lore dumping, part two feels like it's more afraid to explain things than the first, possibly because of complaints that \"nothing happened\" in the first movie. The result of this is that the second movie is much more action-heavy, but it still wants to include the complex topics from the book, so what we get is a bunch of action sequences with scenes of political complexities strung in between them, but without the full explanations necessary to clarify them. It's easy to understand why people who haven't read the books would feel confused by this, the movie barely takes the time to explain what's happening before it's moving on to the next scene of Fremen blowing up spice haulers.Getting into direct comparisons to the book now, and starting with the first movie: my two biggest issues with the first movie was how they changed Jessica and how they dumbed down the mentats. Starting with mentats, they are a hugely important part of all of the Dune books; Thufir Hawat is essentially a main character in the first book, and Peter de Vries is a terrifying mastermind behind the Harkonnen plans. Part of what triggers Paul's first vision of the coming Jihad in his name is that his mother tells him he was trained as a mentat from birth without his knowledge. In the movie, the word mentat is never said once; Paul's mentat training isn't brought up; Thufir Hawat is just a guy who rolls his eyes back in his head, says something smart and then disappears at the halfway mark; and Peter de Vries dies of poisoning. How disappointing.But what I think is the worse change that they made from the book is how they changed Jessica's character. While the Dune books get much more feminist as they go on, the first book has very few female characters. However, Jessica makes for a very strong main character: she has complete control over her mind and body, and through her Bene Gesserit training she has almost superhuman strength, speed, and can control others with the Voice. Her internal monologue also shows that she's almost always two steps ahead of everyone except Paul. In the movies, Jessica feels much weaker. In the first movie she's almost always crying or on the verge of tears, which makes it a lot believable when she starts killing Harkonnens with her bear hands, and it makes the scene in the tent when Paul gets his vision (the only part of the book where Jessica openly grieves) much less powerful.Moving on to the second movie is where the changes get more disappointing. The movie begins with Paul, Jessica and the Fremen fighting the Harkonnens in some battle between the fight with Jamis and them getting to Sietch Tabr, which wasn't in the book and felt like it was added for the sake of starting with an action sequence. After the fight, Jessica throws up involuntarily --- again, as a Bene Gesserit she should have total control over her body and it doesn't make sense for her to do that, even though she's pregnant.Speaking of Jessica's child, Alia isn't really a character in this, at least not like she was in the book. I can understand this, I had no idea how they were going to handle having a toddler who walks and talks like an adult and kills a man, and they handled it by having Jessica not give birth during the movie. They also don't really explain how Alia is pre-born, which is a piece of information that people who didn't read the book could probably use.Once Paul and Jessica get to Sietch Tabr, things feel a lot different. The book describes the interiors of the Sietch as being covered with drapery, rugs, and cushions. There are classrooms, plastic factories, and workshops. The movie doesn't show this at all: the Sietch interior is all smooth, carved stone rather than natural rock walls, there's no textiles to be seen, and essentially only the water reservoir is shown. In general, the depiction of the Fremen in the movie is much worse than the book. The Fremen are a very tight-knit community where people understand each other's needs so well that they don't even need to communicate them out loud. When Jessica feels like she needs a coffee, a Fremen with coffee simply appears without her giving an order. In the movie the Fremen are three things: good at stabbing people, fanatic believers in Paul, or people who hate the Mahdi prophecy and don't believe in Paul. In the book, this dissenting faction against Paul isn't really present, and Chani definitely isn't part of it. I can understand that the filmmakers probably added it to help drive home the anti-hero worship message which a lot of people missed from the book, but it could have been executed better.I also disliked how they changed Chani. In the books she very easily falls for Paul and gives him unwavering support, and I think it's fine that they wanted to make that more nuanced for the movies, but I don't like the way they did it. The movie wants us to think that they love each other even though it constantly shows Chani ranting against the prophecy and disagreeing with Paul's actions. In the end, she leaves Paul after he agrees to marry the Emperor's daughter Irulan (even though in the book he makes it clear that he is only marrying her for politics, refuses to even touch her, and has three children with Chani instead). This ending will definitely complicate things if they do go through with adapting Dune Messiah to complete the film trilogy.I'm running out of room to write, and most people probably won't read this anyway because of the length, so I'll just say again that I enjoyed the movies and think they're good, but some of the changes they made, especially in part two, were disappointing and could have been executed better.", "rating": 8, "sentiment": 1, "date": "2 March 2024", "name": "wilsoncharlie-45676"}

{"id": 44, "title": "Dark & Brooding, Read The Books First!", "content": "Dune 2I enjoyed it immensely!This started continuously from the first movie, and luckily I rewatched the first movie in preparation, I would suggest this is a must! Again the movie was merciless, if you had not read the books you would be lost from the start as no explanation was offered, and perhaps should go home at this point lolPart 2 of the book is about the coming true of the Arakan prophecy of a messiah that will lead the fremen to a \"green paradise\". So it is dark and religiously \"top heavy\", and so was this movie. A brooding dark serious movie with Paul and Jessica struggling with their inner demons for most of the time and tons of set piece Marshall combats. No gags here!Mr Villineuve again achieved the impossible by bringing to life this most complex of novels for the fans and it was really quite brilliant and needs to be watched numerous times.Without undermining the brilliant acting from the cast, Timothee Chalamet was outstanding in his ability to command the screen and convey we were in the presence of a messiah, he was never off the screen and it was deeply moving. The element about Paul being able to see backwards and forwards in time, whilst mentioned was not demonstrated really very effectively. Secondly, we needed more demonstration of the voice in its subtleties.There were several divergences from the book, Paul's integration into the Fremen took 3 years and Alia was born with the memories of her ancestors and excellent with a knife, this seemed to happened over a summer in the movie. Secondly Chani stands by Paul's side throughout even through a political marriage, the movie diverges from this. However Mr Villeneuve condensed the spirit of the book without diluting its impetus and Frank Herbert's intentions were respected.Perhaps more controversial, and of course it's my opinion, there was, unfortunately, to my mind, one glaring problem, there just was no on-screen chemistry between Timothee and Zendaya, it just didn't work, also her acting grated, she seemed to have attended the AB school of acting, using just 2 faces that conveyed petulance, irritation or indeed trapped wind! She just overworked most of it as if it was for TV, we all know, for movie acting \"less is more\", she looked the part, but there just was just no sexual frisson, and the accent was too american, everyone else modified their to be from \"nowhere\" exactly, so she was miscast. I have seen this actress now in Spider-Man, Euphoria and now this, she lacks thespianic skills to convey anything more than the superficial, just no heft! Florence Pugh would have made a better Chani as that lady has the skills when she's humble!I thought Austin Butler was brilliant as the evil nephew, bulked up and without eyebrows, and the teeth, it was a terrific transformation and I love it!The music was amazing throughout as were the worms and battle sequences, the CGI set a new standard in meticulous and seamingless continuity, we were there, we had a parched throat and sand in our faces, I did the sand walk back to the underground lol!This is, of course a must see, and I'm giving it a 9 outta 10, brilliant except for the romantic elements, pathetic, and passionless!", "rating": 9, "sentiment": 1, "date": "2 March 2024", "name": "martimusross"}
{"id": 45, "title": "Technical perfection", "content": "This movie, about Paul Atreides who unites with Chani and the Fremen while seeking revenge against the conspirators who destroyed his family, is a great sequel to Dune (2021)!I had pretty high expectations because of its amazing feedback, and it sure is fantastic. I think the first movie is a masterpiece, but there are a few elements that slightly detracts my experience with Dune: Part Two. I haven't read the book, but I think the pacing and build-up are the main elements that has some flaws. The pacing frequently stumbles a bit, making it sometimes difficult to interpret what the movie tries to convey. I love all the characters themselves, but some of the characters from Dune lose a part of their values in Dune: Part Two and while the story builds up the excitement for the new characters, the way the story deals with the new characters is not deserved, especially with Emperor Shaddam Corrino IV and Feyd-Rautha Harkonnen, the cousin of the protagonist, Paul Atreides. As I interpret it, it was not the Emperor who started the war, but Reverend Mother Gaius Helen Mohiam, planning in the shadows. I think something is not quite right how the movie deals with the Emperor. It feels like something big is going to happen to him, but then he easily loses the battle in the third act, then becomes a prisoner to Paul, and then Feyd-Rautha loses his dual against Paul after he desires to take the Emperor's throne, which should feel like an essential part of the story. My point is, it feels like everything builds up to something but immediately gets thrown away when it faces its challenge, making it leave me with a somewhat disappointment. To add, I kind of wish there was more action and explorations of new worlds, but as said, I have not read the book, so I probably should not dare to criticize the movie too much based on the story.Anyway, the rest of the movie is incredible. I really enjoy the development of Paul from being a curious helper to a confident central figure. He still has dreams, but the more he develops, the clearer the possibilities of the future are to him. I love the way he lifts and clarifies his position among the people, making him look like a very powerful person. My favorite scene is probably when Paul walks in the crowd while he wears a cloak and the awesome score by Hans Zimmer plays in the background. Absolutely cinematic. The romance between him and Chani is nice, Stilgar is the nice touch of humor, and the transformation of the mother of Paul Atreides, Lady Jessica, is interesting. I think the connection and communication between Lady Jessica and her daughter are very compelling. It feels mysterious, and how the daughter is trying to take a part of the future is cool. Although Anya Taylor-Joy (as the daughter of Lady Jessica) only has one scene, it does much to the story. The glimpse of the eyes of Taylor-Joy just melt me, perfectly convincing me that her character is the upcoming sister of Paul. Although I think the movie slightly lacks action, the action itself is masterful. The choreography is fantastic, the visuals in general are insane, and the best of all is the sound design. Absolutely breathtaking because it proves that it is one of the most epic movies ever. Although the score doesn't take as much part of the movie as what the score from Dune does, it is still amazingly good. It is darker and rawer, making some of the elements of the movie more threatening.My complaints are only minor ones although I write much about them, but that is because they go against my high expectations. But all in all, the movie is such a great experience, especially on the big screen. No matter how much I think it will increase my enjoyment during a rewatch, I am confident that the experience will get somewhat better the second time.In conclusion, despite pacing issues and underdeveloped new characters, this movie delivers a visually stunning and thrilling experience. The movie excels in its technical aspects, boasting masterful action sequences, breathtaking visuals, and an immersive soundscape. While the story falters slightly in its execution, particularly with its portrayal of the antagonists, it effectively portrays the transformation of Paul and the intriguing development of the supporting characters, especially Lady Jessica and her daughter. Overall, the movie is a worthy sequel that builds upon the strengths of the first movie and offers a compelling cinematic experience, especially on the big screen. However, a second viewing might be necessary to fully appreciate the nuances and complexities of the movie.", "rating": 8, "sentiment": 1, "date": "28 February 2024", "name": "mieriks"}

{"id": 47, "title": "A Spectacle Indeed-But Story/Characters Lag Behind Predecessor", "content": "Dune 2 is a big screen action/adventure spectacle the likes of which hasn't been seen since, well, maybe the first Dune in 2021. But when it comes to paying off what the original effort set up so perfectly, this sophomore sequel doesn't quite hit it out of the park.For a very basic overview, Dune 2 picks up with Paul (Timothee Chalamet) and mother Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson) living amongst the Fremen after House Atreides being all but wiped out in the House Harkonnen collaboration with the Emperor's army to re-take Arrakis. Though Jessica and Stilgar (Javier Bardem) continue to tout Paul as the mythical prophesized messiah per the Bene Gesserit religious sect, Paul isn't yet convinced-nor are other Fremen like Chani (Zendaya). Will Paul accept the mantle and risk all-out religious war-or choose to remain embedded \"locally\" with the Fremen? Meanwhile, Baron Harkonnen (Stellan Skarsgard) is struggling to control spice production on Arrakis, so unhinged nephew Feyd-Rautha (Austin Butler) is called in for assistance. Finally, the Emperor (Christopher Walken) and Princess Irulan (Florence Pugh) scheme to keep themselves in power over all of the machinations.There is absolutely no doubt that Dune 2 is cinema spectacle of the highest order. Director Denis Villeneuve composes a film that should be seen in the biggest format possible (to truly appreciate the scale) and within the best sound structure (Dolby Atmos for me and it was theater-rumbling!). There is never a dull moment from beginning to end-always something interesting to look at or immerse yourself in on screen.Here's the issue with Dune 2: the first film was one of the best world-building setups I've ever seen in a flick. It expertly dropped viewers into the planetary conflict, gradually built up the key characters, and imbued it all with a sense of great mystery and intrigue. While this sequel technically pays off all those setups, it doesn't always do so in the most satisfying or understandable of ways. I won't go into every nook and cranny here, but a few examples:-Paul resists his messianic calling the entire film-until the end when he just \"gives in\"?-The fetus within Jessica is talking to her and will someday grow up to be Anya Taylor-Joy's brief cameo character?-Even after Paul accepts his mantle-the Houses won't acknowledge him?-The bombshell of Paul's more-diverse-than-we-realized bloodline came off as anticlimactic, especially considering how it immediately becomes the driving force of the film's endgame.I know that there is an answer to every question posed above-but none of it felt all that satisfactory or revelatory to me. Part of the problem could be that I was expecting more of a definitive ending and received a \"setting up a franchise\" denouement instead. A particularly telling observation was how my favorite character in the entire movie was Butler's Feyd-Rautha. Why? Because-like in Dune 1-it was something completely different/new and shrouded in mystery that Villeneuve was able to unwind.So, in my final reckoning of Dune 2, the visual spectacle and star-studded cast do most of the heavy-lifting. If you don't see this one from a theater seat at least once, you are doing yourself a disservice. But if you are looking for a plot-tight, perfectly character-fulfilling narrative, you may walk away a little disappointed (at least compared to the first Villeneuve Dune).", "rating": 7, "sentiment": 1, "date": "1 March 2024", "name": "zkonedog"}

{"id": 49, "title": "Dune: Part Two", "content": "This is certainly a great looking film to see on a big screen with some really effective, almost industrially sounding, audio - but what happened to the story? It's wafer thin and really stretched out for 2\u00be hours. We pick up with \"Paul\" (Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet) and his mother (Rebecca Ferguson) trying to convince the \"Fremen\" that they are worth the hassle. Fortunately, leader \"Stilgar\" (Javier Bardem) is convinced of the messianic state of the young refugee, whilst their own reverend mother is on her last legs which might give \"Jessica\" a chance to prove her own worth, and provide an opportunity to peddle some embellished mythology about her son's ascendant propheteering. All of this manoeuvring and politicking is having quite an impact on \"Chani\" (the under-used Zendaya) and on the relationship between her and the increasingly worshipped new Duke. Meantime, now fully reinvigorated and emerged from his bath of recuperative Guinness, the evil \"Baron Harkonnen\" (an almost Zeppelin-like Stellan Skarsg\u00e5rd) has recruited his lethal nephew \"Feyd-Rautha\" (Austin Butler) to get to grips with the rebellion on \"Arrakis\" that is bringing him into the gaze of an ill-satisfied emperor (Christopher Walken). Battle lines are drawn! Now whilst I did enjoy this, the rest of the film is a gloriously photographed but slowly paced hybrid of \"Khartoum\" (1966) and \"Lawrence of Arabia\" (1962) with a bit of the \"Phantom Menace\" (1999) thrown in for good measure. The acting is adequate but the characterisations are all too routinely sacrificed at the altar of the stunning visuals and from about an hour to go, I was convinced this this was but part two of three (or maybe even more). Walken and Charlotte Rampling feature all too sparingly to make much difference, indeed even Zendaya's warrior-like tendencies seem to have been neutered rather and I though that Chalamet just tried far too hard to imbue his character with a strength that he was far more successful with first time round. That said, it does work well enough as a classy and well produced sci-fi adventure with plenty of action and mysticism but I needed more meat on it's bones.

{"id": 53, "title": "The spice of life.", "content": "'Dune: Part Two (2024)' is the continuation of Denis Villeneuve's adaptation of Frank Herbert's seminal sci-fi novel, beginning almost exactly where 'Dune (2021)' ends. It follows Paul Atreides as he integrates with the Fremen and attempts to learn their ways in order to help them overthrow the brutal Harkonnen regime now controlling Arakkis and just maybe get some good old-fashioned revenge in the process. For me, this represents a major step up from the previous part. It's significantly better than its predecessor in pretty much every way, with a thematically intriguing story that actually justifies an almost three-hour runtime and some of the most impressively tactile visuals I've ever seen (there isn't a single second where you think \"that's a good effect\", not because the effects aren't phenomenal but because they're so seamlessly integrated with the set and costume design that they feel just as real as the actors themselves). Its world is holistic and utterly immersive, captured with stunning cinematography and soul-shaking sound design, and its narrative actually engages you on an emotional level (something I felt was almost entirely lacking from the first film). It's actually really tragic overall, and it's pretty unconventional in terms of blockbuster storytelling. Furthermore, a lot of its weight is conveyed without the need for dialogue, with the performers often speaking volumes without ever opening their mouths. The cast all do an excellent job, but for me it's perhaps Zendaya who stands out the most. I do need to mention Austin Butler, Javier Bardem, Stellan Skarsg\u00e5rd, Josh Brolin and, of course, Wonka himself Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet as other notable actors in a movie comprised pretty much solely of top-tier talent working at the top of their game. That's a good way to describe the entire picture really: it's the product of a crew comprised entirely of people working at the very top of their game. It really is an incredible experience. The stakes are genuine, the set-pieces are exciting (and suspenseful), the score is colossal, the effects are impeccable, the cinematography is gorgeous, the sound design is otherworldly, the acting is flawless, the editing is effortlessly effective and the overall direction is nothing short of masterful. It's a really enjoyable epic that feels immense in every sense of the word.

More characters are added, the story is now more complex and 10x interesting with much going on, and the world of Dune is bigger.However, with lots of negativities in my opinion, the positivities are much stronger to not ruin the experience nor lower the rating.Director Denis Villeneuve proves himself again in Part Two that he is the perfect director to direct the Dune project. In addition, all the crew that helped in delivering this project truly did an accurate and amazing job to deliver this world the way it is supposed to be delivered.The VFX in this film is absolutely amazing and not noticeable expect for very few scenes that is obvious about the use of green screens but this will not ruin the experience at all. Also, the cinematography that captures Arrakis (where most of the film is held in) absolutely supports the VFX in capturing some great shots that most of them are long wide shots to capture the beautiful desert. Moreover, most of the times the characters are positioned to be in the middle of the long wide shot to capture the size of the character comparing to the world around them mostly to show off their vulnerability or their strong abilities depending in the character.The film is so much inspired by the middle eastern culture in terms of the language, clothings, production design, movements, and all the beliefs that most of the characters follow.Hans Zimmer's music is perfectly composed and really loved how in most of the fight sequences, there is no music to be played in the background making the whole attention pointed towards the fight movements which increases the nervousness and tense vibe.Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet and Zendaya are absolutely amazing. Paul Atreides (played by Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet) have reached his peak and prime level. By the end of this film, he is no longer the young Paul Atreides, he is the most powerful man in Arrakis and no one can top him nor control him. He is written with so much care that will make you recall the version that we saw in Part One and how his long journey that we experienced with him wasn't that easy. And this might be one of the greatest character studies/character development stories in cinema history, and Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet had a huge part in achieving that. By the end of Part Two, you will realize that Chalamet is indeed the perfect actor to portray Paul Atreides due to Chalamet's deep portraying during the different stages that his character goes through in this film and mostly moments of anger and strength on other characters. However, the real surprise is Rebecca Ferguson as her character really went through many changes in this film in which it was really shown due to Rebecca's acting. She was absolutely able to deliver the terrifying and powerful characteristics of her character Jessica. The second biggest surprise is Austin Butler as Fyed-Rautha as both his make-up design and acting was able to bring this character to screen the way it is suppose to be in the book.For the negativities:-With the same mistake that is in Dune Part One, Part Two (and the whole Dune saga) highly needs to be 'Rated R' to allow some gore, bloody, and disgusting violence scenes to be present in the film, and part Two has the perfect chance due to the amount of fight sequences specifically with Austin Butler's character, Feyd-Rautha that had epic fight sequences that were shot in Black & White and I think it's obvious the reason behind shooting them in Black & White.-Unfortunately the seriousness in this film has been lowered significantly. Especially with Javier Bardem's character Stilgar that cracks most of the jokes. What happened to Stolgar that walked in on Oscar Isaac's Duke Leto Atredius in Part One with much confident and seriousness refusing to give anything about his people?Also, Dave Batista's character Glossu Rabban is so weak in this film and we barely saw him defending himself or even being powerful which is something that does not fit with Batista's physical appearance nor the character's characteristics or the 'brutal' House Harkonnen that he represents.-(NOT A SPOILER AS IT WAS ANNOUNCED BY DIRECTOR DENIS VILLENEUVE)\nLastly, in case you didn't know, during the London premiere of Dune Part Two, actress Anya Taylor-Joy appeared at the red carpet and it was announced that the actress will be having a small surprise appearance role in the film. Can I understand why this was announced and why wasn't it kept as a surprise like it was this whole time????? Since when do actors and actresses that have a surprise role in a film appear at the red carpet premiere? This makes her appearance at the carpet very much useless and it truly ruined the surprise that was kept hidden perfectly the past few years.", "rating": 9, "sentiment": 1, "date": "26 February 2024", "name": "Aziz24"}

The colors are vivid, the lighting is gorgeous and the cgi is mostly indistinguishable from reality.That said, despite being almost 3 hours long, the story felt hugely condensed. It felt like each scene gives you the bare minimum to understand what's happening, but elaborates on nothing. It felt like it wants you to immerse yourself in a unique and complex world, but gives every setting only a few minutes of time before hopping straight to the next. For example, the training of Paul. We never see him learn how to ride the sandworm, so when he succeeds, it doesn't feel as triumphant as it would have otherwise. The Harkonnens are also much less intimidating than they were before. Most of their screentime is comprised of them trying and failing to farm spice on Arrakis, until they are defeated by Paul and the Fremen at the end without much difficulty. They should have put up more of a fight. Lastly, I know from sources that an ecological message the was very important in the book was emmited completely from the film. The Fremen speak of bringing green back to Arrakis, but that's all we ever see them do.Part of it may be a limitation of the format. If one must adapt a book full of complex lore, than either a trilogy or even a serialization may be the better option as you get more time to explain everything. I know that a third film is coming but it's not based on the same book anymore, and while I haven't read any of the books, I don't believe I should.

Sci-fi has rarely looked or sounded better.However, in terms of story the movie somehow felt long yet condensed/rushed at the same time. Scenes seemed to move from one to the next because the story needed to move on, not being driven by character or emotion. Some relationships felt underdeveloped, and the story progression at times felt incohesive (like someone accidentally pressed the \"skip to next chapter\" button and you feel like you've missed something).A very good movie - visually and acoustically perfect - but with some story and pacing issues that had it fall short of total perfection, for me.\n                \n                    5 out of 6 found this helpful.\n                        \n                            Was this review helpful?

The cast as expected is masterclass and I especially really enjoyed Bardem and Butler this time around and Denis will most likely get a best director nomination next year.Even though there is no doubt about its \"epicness\" I found it to have an even bigger pacing issue than the first one. Somewhere midway through it had me looking at my watch wondering if it is close to ending and found out that we are just grazing into the second act.The third act felt rushed and the conclusion while understandably set up for a continuation in Messiah felt really undeserving and abrupt. I would have liked to expand the third act maybe 20 more minutes just to have the movie conclude at a satisfying point rather than in the middle of the story exactly as the first one did. I might pump this up to a 9 if the next movie concludes the story in a satisfying manner.Overall a great film with many flaws that I unfortunately can't look past.

{"id": 60, "title": "Epic and powerful (but not perfect) cinematic masterpiece", "content": "Denis Villeneuve proves once again for being one of the greatest filmmakers of our time with Dune Part 2 being possibly his greatest movie so far.Dune Part 2 is everything you want for a sequel. It's bigger, boulder and slightly better than its predecessor. This movie concludes the first movie in a very satisfying way as you keep rooting for Paul in his revenge quest and rise to power.This movie has more action scenes, explosions and violence than the first film but keeps the same tone in the world building, mysticism and grounded character moments.Visually and technically this movie is masterpiece.There are some scenes that will stay with you even after the credits roll, wanting to go see the film again just to relive the spectacle you just witnessed (those who've seen it, you know which scenes I'm talking about...). CGI is also used sparingly just to amplify the screenplay in large scenes.Direction and writing of this movie is top notch and satisfying for the viewer. The movie creates tension in the beginning and peaks strongly towards the end (unlike Oppenheimer). There are no pacing issues.Storywise the movie succeeds in the message its trying to deliver thanks to the cast and especially Timoth\u00e9e Calamet's strong performance. I was worried that Paul Atreides' journey of becoming the chosen \"jihad messiah\" would not be believable at all, given the main actors young age. To my surprise this was all done very well and Timoth\u00e9e Calamet managed to shift his characters personality in a drastic way, which made him seem like a totally different person at the end, the kind of fanatic leader the masses would follow. This is partly for the credit of the rest of the cast that genuinely seem to worship and uplift the young man to power.However, there are some minor faults in this movie but only minor since the movie could have been even better and elevated into perfection with only a few fixes in my opinion.Firstly, the events of the movie and planet Arrakis are supposed to control the fate of the entire universe. Sadly the film doesn't make us feel this intergalactic conflict since it focuses only on the two houses, Harkonnen and Atreides. Events take place mainly on Arrakis and the world isn't expanded much. This could've been fixed with just extra 5 - 10 minutes by showing us a few different planets, cultures and other great houses reacting to the conflict or talking about it in some manner. Sadly we dont have a director's cut to show us what could've been.Secondly, the movie feels somewhat one dimensional because of the interplay of the story and the music. Although fantastic, Hans Zimmer's score is quite loud and pushes the audience to feel the \"epicness\" \"darkness\" and sense of \"doom\" to the point of exhaustion throughout the 3 hour runtime. There aren't enough calm and beautiful moments and gentle musical pieces to balance out these emotions, other than a few between Chani and Paul.Other movies of this genre (e.g. Star Wars, Interstellar) manage to evoke many different emotions throughout the film. But since this movie is mainly about revenge, power and conquest the score suits the plot well. But in the end the movie evokes only one kind of emotion with its themes and music to complement it. This could've been fixed with maybe revisiting Paul's early family life in flashbacks or something else that's tonally different to the main feel of the movie. For these reasons I must say I felt a sleight sense of emptiness after leaving the theatre.Despite these few critiques, the movie succeeds on every front and brings home the main theme of revenge and justice in a very satisfying way for the audience and concludes the setup in the first installment very well. Dune Part 2 is an epic visual masterpiece and will remain as one of the greatest Sci-fi films of this generation.Rating: 8,3 stars.", "rating": 8, "sentiment": 1, "date": "29 February 2024", "name": "junttilajuhamatias"}
{"id": 61, "title": "Masterpiece!!!!!!! Setting the benchmark for all upcoming sci-fi movies...", "content": "Denis Villeneuve's \"Dune: Part Two\" arrives, fulfilling the promise of its predecessor with stunning visuals, epic action sequences, and a deeper dive into Frank Herbert's captivating universe.The film is a feast for the eyes. From the vast, shimmering deserts of Arrakis to the intricate designs of the Fremen culture, every frame is meticulously crafted and awe-inspiring. Building on the foundation laid in Part One, the action is bigger, bolder, and more thrilling. The sandworm battles are particularly impressive, showcasing the immense power and scale of these creatures. While the first half focuses heavily on world-building, the sequel delves deeper into character development. We see Paul Atreides (Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet) grapple with his destiny, Lady Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson) navigate the Fremen power dynamics, and Chani (Zendaya) emerge as a strong voice of reason. The cast delivers strong performances across the board. Chalamet continues to impress as the conflicted Paul, while Ferguson brings depth and complexity to Lady Jessica. Zendaya shines with her nuanced portrayal of Chani, and the supporting cast, including Javier Bardem and Josh Brolin, adds further weight to the narrative.The film's first half feels rushed at times, cramming in a lot of exposition to catch viewers up on plot points left unresolved in Part One. This can be jarring for those unfamiliar with the source material. While visually stunning, the film struggles to match the emotional weight of the first installment. The complex themes of power, destiny, and ecological balance are present, but not fully explored. The film ends on a cliffhanger, setting the stage for a potential third part. While this may leave some viewers satisfied, others might find it frustrating.The cinematography by Greig Fraser is magnificent, capturing the vastness of Arrakis and the intricate details of the Fremen culture. The score by Hans Zimmer is once again powerful and evocative, adding to the film's epic atmosphere. The sound design is immersive, placing viewers right in the heart of the action.\"Dune: Part Two\" is a visually stunning and action-packed continuation of the epic saga. While the pacing and emotional impact are not quite as strong as the first film, the performances, technical aspects, and deeper exploration of the characters and world make it a worthwhile experience for fans of science fiction and grand-scale storytelling. However, be prepared for a conclusion that leaves you wanting more.", "rating": 10, "sentiment": 1, "date": "5 March 2024", "name": "SonGoku540"}
{"id": 62, "title": "\"Power over spice is power over all.\"", "content": "FILM: 9.0\nDenis Villeneuve returns to the world of Dune, affirming his status as an auteur in the process. It's something I always suspected would be the case; he simply hasn't had the opportunity to demonstrate it until now. With Dune: Part Two, he solidifies his position as a master storyteller.Having laid the expositional groundwork and world-building in the first film, Villeneuve now delves deeper into character development. He expands his palette, intertwining explorations of culture, religion, and politics seamlessly into the narrative while maintaining a brisk pace of action.Performances across the board are stellar. Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet shows considerable growth, both as an actor and in his portrayal of Paul Atreides. Rebecca Ferguson's expanded role is a welcomed addition, adding a touch of menace. However, it's Javier Bardem's performance that truly shines, infusing the lengthy film with heart and humour.Villeneuve's direction proves that what was once deemed unfilmable is not only achievable but can be a triumph of filmmaking. The grandeur of the desert landscapes, the intricacies of the political machinations, and the emotional depth of the characters are all brought to life with stunning precision.My first watch of Dune: Part Two was an immersive and unforgettable experience. Villeneuve's vision, coupled with outstanding performances and breathtaking visuals, creates a cinematic near-masterpiece that transcends its genre. It's a testament to the power of storytelling and solidifies Dune as a modern classic. With its compelling narrative and thought-provoking themes, this film is a must-watch for cinephiles and casual viewers alike.FORMAT: CinemaVIDEO: 10.0\n4K theatrical presentation\nDetail level: Excellent\nColour reproduction: Excellent\nLevel accuracy: Excellent\nEncode: Excellent\nMaster condition: ExcellentAUDIO: 10.0\nDolby Atmos theatrical audio\nDialogue reproduction: Excellent\nSoundtrack & effects clarity: Excellent\nDynamics: Excellent\nSurround sound presentation: Excellent\nLFE content: ExcellentMOOFIEMETER: 9.0.", "rating": 9, "sentiment": 1, "date": "13 March 2024", "name": "gettodamoofies"}
{"id": 63, "title": "Dune Part Two is a remarkable addition to the science fiction genre and a must-see epic", "content": "My wife and I attended a screening of Dune II (2024) last night. The storyline follows Paul as he establishes himself among the Fremen, torn between being seen as a messiah and viewing himself as an ordinary man seeking revenge. His budding relationship with Chani adds complexity, as he grapples with love versus the expectations of becoming a Messiah. Meanwhile, the success in repelling world invaders attracts a formidable opponent poised to stop them and annihilate the Fremen.Directed by Denis Villeneuve (Blade Runner 2049), the film stars Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet (Wonka), Zendaya (Euphoria), Josh Brolin (No Country for Old Men), Javier Bardem (No Country for Old Men), Austin Butler (Elvis), Christopher Walken (Deer Hunter), David Bautista (Guardians of the Galaxy), and Florence Pugh (Black Widow).Dune Part Two is a cinematic masterpiece. The cinematography excels with brilliant use of lighting, attire, camera angles, and settings, crafting an atmospheric and expansive experience. Exceptional makeup and costumes contribute to a mysterious and authentic feel throughout. The characters are unpredictable, exuding grit and determination. The mother's role is outstanding, and the conversations with the sister are mind-blowing. The inclusion of the worms seamlessly fits into the underlying and overarching storyline. The film immerses you in its universe and slowly builds anticipation for the epic battle. The action, when it unfolds, is brutal, intense, and keeps the audience on the edge of their seats. My only critique is that the film could have been better edited for length.In conclusion, Dune Part Two is a remarkable addition to the science fiction genre and a must-see epic. I would rate it 9/10 and highly recommend.", "rating": 9, "sentiment": 1, "date": "3 March 2024", "name": "kevin_robbins"}

I really like book adaptations where it's clear that the director is passionate and respectful of the source material. It's no secret the Villeneuve has loved Dune and planned on making his own version before he even made a movie. He even did Arrival and Blade Runner 2049 first, as to have the experience making sci-fi movies, so he felt adequately prepared to tackle Dune. It's too bad that he will not be adapting any more Dune books after Messiah.

{"id": 67, "title": "Sci-fi masterpiece", "content": "Dune: Part Two is intelligent blockbuster filmmaking at its finest. An epic tragedy told on the biggest canvas imaginable with every department operating in unison and at the top of their game. The first Dune may have focused on the set-up but that doesn't mean this one is rushing straight into the action, maintaining that immersive slow burning nature.Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet got a nice journey in the original, however this one is so much bigger. He plays the internal conflict so well as he tries his best to avoid his destiny and by the end he feels like a different person entirely in a way that doesn't come out of nowhere. In those earlier moments he also displays palpable chemistry with Zendaya as they begin to truly connect.As well as having that strong chemistry with Chalamet, Zendaya is given so much more to do here (as promised), essentially becoming co-lead. As the film descends further in its climactic moments, she remains the only one who's able to see through the manipulation that's happening with a fair few moments where her looks of frustration say everything.There are so many huge names in this cast that don't get much in an impactful way. All of them are fully committed to their smaller parts with Austin Butler being a major highlight. The film describes him as psychotic and honestly that's putting it mildly. His deliberate impersonation of the Baron really works to make him even more unsettling.It's clear from its first major action sequence, bathed in a beautiful orange hue, that director Denis Villeneuve is a master of the craft at this point. Even compared to Part One, the scale of this chapter is immense with returning cinematographer Greig Fraser bringing his specific set of skills to make this an undeniable cinematic event.Considering how good his previous score was, Hans Zimmer could've easily coasted for this one by just reusing all of those themes but it's obvious that he wouldn't do that because he clearly loves playing in this sandbox.

Yes, he's psychotic and needs to constantly look up beneath a furrowed hairless brow to show us that, but he's not scary or threatening.Maybe I need to watch it again, but I was disappointed for sure, and I don't really know if it's just me missing something or if everyone's expectations of good films are being watered down, and we're forgetting that good movies get under your skin, whereas this one barely made a scratch.", "rating": 4, "sentiment": 0, "date": "5 March 2024", "name": "zureal-77671"}

I can't keep track of any of the characters names, I have only a basic understanding of who is doing what, I am not mesmerised by Timothee Chalamet nor Zendaya's acting. They both seem kind of wooden to me. Also, by about the 17th or 18th time they push in for a super close up on Zendaya's weird face and linger there for what seemed like hours on end, I began to grow weary.I don't know, I think I must be the problem.

{"id": 85, "title": "The sort of movie that makes you believe in the blockbuster again.", "content": "2023 was widely seen as the year the blockbuster died (I think that's hyperbolic, but let's go with it). A year with more flops than successes, a lot of audiences seemed to finally reject the endless stream of sequels, requels, and adaptations we'd gotten so accustomed to. And then, you have Dune Part II.If anything, this movie proves that it's not \"adaptation\" that's the problem. It's having a purpose to doing it. I can't think of a more relevant property (and one that deserves proper cinematic treatment) than Dune. To be clear, I haven't even read the books, only gleaming what I know about them from pop culture, but like all great adaptations, now I want to read the series.Where do I even start with Dune Part II? It's a gorgeous spectacle with richly layered characters and amazing performances; chock full of thought provoking ideas. This is a movie that reminds you why film - I'm just calling it here - is the best medium for storytelling. It combines every other aspect of art into a singular product. Visually and sonically, Dune Part II is on another level. I was lucky enough to see this thing in IMAX and it was truly worth it. Some frames look like paintings and there are gorgeous images that I'm still ruminating on a day after. The entire sequence of Geidi Prime, with the monochrome lighting, was such a perfect examples of how you can use the genre of science fiction to do something truly astounding visually. Having also recently seen Madame Web, this movie really made me appreciate great sound design and engineering.Another thing I have to highlight is the film's amazing editing. There's a lot of moving parts in this movie and a lot that apparently had to be cut. While it's not entirely perfect and some things are gleamed over (more on that later), I have to applaud the editors for making this unwieldy, massive story so digestible.But, the thing that really sets Dune Part II apart (even from its predecessors) are the characters, themes, and performances. Every character here - for the most part - is better than in the original, the mark of a great sequel. If you felt the original film felt \"cold\" and lacking in humanity, this movie is the exact opposite (not to mention the seemingly thousands of extras - although I'm sure they're mostly CG at this point). There's so much humanity here; so many relationships and ideas about people explored and enriched.Timothee Chalemet may have delivered his defining performance in this movie. His Paul Atreides perfectly conveys the complex and nuanced character he's supposed to be; a boy turned man who is torn between his sense of justice and kindess, and the reality of power. He really delivers a powerhouse of a performance here.Zendaya is also absolutely awesome in this movie. I loved the ideas and perspectives her character represented and she's entirely believable, as is her relationship with Paul. She's the best example of a female action hero; tough and competent, but not devoid of emotion or longing. Javier Bardem's Stilgar was one character who also really surprised me; he represents the Fremen who genuinely and passionately believe in Paul, yet he's never presented a \"stupid\" person or na\u00efve. He and Zendaya's characters are thankfully, super important to the narrative.Then there's Austin Butler as Feyd Rautha. This is a performance akin to that of Colin Farrell as the Penguin; Butler completely disappears into the role and as murderous as he is, I wanted to see more of him. (Kudos to Villeneuve for having a character like this in a PG-13 film) I was also really impressed by Rebecca Ferguson as Paul's mother, Lady Jessica. Her character conflict in the first didn't really jive well with me, and I'm happy to say she's so much better in this one as a more sinister figure. Really, her decision to tie her political ambitions with her personal wishes reminded me of a less obviously evil Cersei Lannister. And, while his role isn't as big in this one, I can't get enough as Stellan Skarsgard as Vladimir Harkonnen. He's amazing and has so much screen presence.Fundamentally, Dune Part II tackles difficult questions and provides nuanced answers. It's about power and the way it manifests, and to all those who say it's essentially a repackaged \"white saviour\" trope, I feel need to improve their media literacy. Did you watch the movie? I can't think of a film that interrogates and deconstructs this idea more than this one.The movie isn't entirely perfect. I feel that especially towards the end, a lot of things were rushed through, but I understand that heading towards the end of a nearly 3 hour movie, it's hard to justify MORE content. Overall though, believe the hype. Everything about this movie is tip top: the visuals, the costumes (my God, the costumes), the editing, the sound, the acting, the writing, the choreography (I didn't even mention the myriad of amazing set pieces)...yeah, this is blockbuster filmmaking at its finest.

{"id": 87, "title": "Real Modern Classic, Thank You Denis.", "content": "I believe I've witnessed something magnificent, and truly, it shouldn't be watched outside of the IMAX format because regardless of what anyone says, this is a modern classic. I'm writing this review somewhat for myself because years later, when I read it again, I want to see how much I elevated this legend and how it managed to close so many things correctly despite its mini flaws.For the past two days, the film hasn't left my mind, and the reason I give it a perfect 10 is this. Whenever I talk about the film, I get excited because I've seen a visual masterpiece. It has incredible cinematography, beyond amazing. Watching the Lisan al Gaib scene where the Fremen walk from a bird's eye view, the scene between Paul and Feyd at the end, the scene where the Fremen accept Paul, the Harkonnen attack in the opening sequence, and many others, you feel that there are very few scenes like these. Greig Fraser is a master at this. Besides that, Hans Zimmer's music, which doesn't mean much when listened to alone but reaches a tremendous dimension with the sound mixing, adds a whole new dimension to the film. It's truly wonderfully designed and fitted, Denis, you're amazing.And the casting is phenomenal. Dave, Timoth\u00e9e, Florence, Zendaya, Rebecca, Javier, Josh, Austin, they're all fantastic. I won't describe each one separately, saying 'this scene was superb,' everyone fits their role so well and performs so excellently that the film becomes a recital; there isn't a single scene with amateurish or shallow acting. Besides acting, something that needs to be mentioned is the stunts. The fight choreography was quite good and clear, especially the scene between Feyd and Paul at the end, where the music stops and we watch pure fighting for a few minutes, it was wonderful.Besides the cinematography, casting and harmony, the legendary use and synchronization of music, there are two more reasons why this film excels and why I rate it highly. Firstly, the film is superbly adapted, I won't touch upon this further. Secondly, it's a fantastic critique film.The film critiques every mundane and inherent aspect of human nature. Whether it's the dynastic system, coercion around the secret gene preservation logic, the exploitation of religion, political chaos, inefficient use of resources, and many more points, it hits the bullseye so accurately that it's both overwhelming and not tiring while making you feel it, a tremendous achievement.Now, onto the contentious topic of staying faithful to the books and the polemic of how similar it was... Despite everything, it's said that both Part 1 and Part 2 were quite faithful to the book, and I believe they were. Some details might have been skipped or not exactly replicated in the second film, but for such a meta and philosophical book series, this is extremely normal; if everything were portrayed exactly, it might have been incomprehensible. I won't comment on the film's dynasty and operation right now because as a sequel, it has to complete the script with good motivation and also convey the characters it portrays well; I'm very happy it achieved this.The film had a fitting humor, some scenes were mildly funny and unintentionally successful, which was admirable. Also, I think it will sweep the awards at the Oscars next year; it could win for its amazing costumes, production design, adapted screenplay, and maybe even best picture.It's the peak of cinema that I've ever seen; go to IMAX, you won't regret it. I didn't delve into the details because everyone should watch it for themselves and try to interpret it in their own way; it's that kind of film.\"May thy knife chip & shatter.\" March 2024.", "rating": 10, "sentiment": 1, "date": "4 March 2024", "name": "olcare"}

I'm a huge fan of the novels, and in a few ways this movie manages to improve on the source material by giving us a very intimate rendition of this awesome story.It totally kicks ass on all fronts. Writing, visuals, sound design/music, and acting at its absolute highest levels on the grandest scale. Truly epic. One of the best adaptations from novel to screen ever made. No easy task either given the film's source material, but executed tastefully and dare I say, flawlessly utilizing minor alterations to create the best film it can be. Believe the hype. If you don't like this movie, then well, I guess epic sci-fi stories and deserts simply aren't your thing. Fair enough, but for most of us, it really doesn't get any better than this.The script is excellent. This was a very hard novel to adapt, and the writers have truly done a fantastic job with it. Changes have been made from the source material, details added, but essentially it captures the best themes of the book. Overall, each change, cut, or addition makes for a better movie, still remaining faithful to the films source material. I will admit however, that the Dune nerd in me would have liked to see that talking baby... but the way they did it was effective and probably better for the silver screen. Frank Herbert purist might get pretty bummed over this, but not I. The change works well, and I trust Denis Villeneuve with what he wanted to do in his telling.I want to point out that I was kind of surprised how terrific the acting in this film was considering the amount of vanity and celebrity the cast seems to bask in. This isn't just a cast of what Marilyn Manson would call \"the beautiful people\" but actually a talented one. Timothy Chalamet really brings it in the films second half. He was born to play Paul Atreides, and I would have never of known he was capable of pulling it off so well with what I have previously seen him in. I loved Austin Butler as Feyd-Rautha, but it was actually Javier Bardem as Stilgar that I enjoyed the most. His character is beautifully written in this screenplay, providing smart laugh out loud comic relief but also delivering serious dramatic scenes with awesome dialogue. His delivery of \"I don't care if you do not believe, I believe...\" which was perfectly placed in the trailer is even better in the film. The man is a very good actor, obviously given his track record, and it was simply awesome seeing him deliver such well written dialogue.The visual fx... I don't even know how to convey how great they look. They, simply put, are stunning. What a treat to see it in IMAX. This movie truly was made for IMAX. It looks incredible.Which brings me to cinematography. Also stunning. Absolute perfection. The lighting and color pallets... my God, it's just stunning.Sound design and score are every bit as awesome as they were in the first film. Perfection. Hans Zimmer is really in the prime of his career, giving us stunningly original and memorable works of music.As far as memorable scenes and sequences go, every single one hits pretty hard and is expertly crafted. The climatic final knife fight was the best I had scene since the climatic sword fight in Rob Roy. But I can't write this gushing review without mentioning the sand-worm riding scene where Paul first mounts one of these iconic beast. WOW. This goes down as one of my favorite scenes ever in a film. I practically edged myself off my seat, even knowing what the outcome would be having read the book. It was just... wow, so cool.Upon the movie ending, my wife and I just wanted to stay in the theater and watch it over again. I can't wait to see this film again, and again, and again. I really think it is a modern classic. This isn't something I say lightly. The hype was real for me. I hope you all feel the same as I did, because both Dune and Dune: Part 2 are some of the greatest times I've had at the movies in the past twenty years. This is what large budget major studio films should be. This is art on its grandest scale, not just a cheap attempt to cash in on a beloved franchise. It's so refreshing and nice to see that Hollywood still has a few quality films to make. In my personal opinion, Timothy Chalamet and Zendaya earned every right to wear those ludicrous outfits on the red carpet. They could have worn hot dog suits for all I care, because not only did they do a fantastic job, but the entire cast and crew.

He stayed as true as possible to the original story with very few, albeit minor changes from the novel. The reasons behind this were understandable; deliver Frank Herbert's \"Dune\" in a manner that modern audiences could digest and walk away from understanding and appreciating what they had just experienced.Dune: Part Two arrives; critics and influencers alike are toting the film as a \"masterclass of filmmaking\" and \"best science fiction movie of all time to date\".I am fair and give credit where credit is due. The characters and their execution of their roles were flawless, the cinematography was awe-inspiring, the action was jaw-dropping, and the musical scoring was outstanding setting every mood and tone perfectly.So, why six stars? The story. Hands down, the story.There are creative liberties taken by Villeneuve that I believe hurts the original material. Many of these liberties are easily identified in the film by \"holy crap!\" moments, and the *GASP* moments in the film. Granted, while, once again, masterfully executed, they accomplished exactly what it felt like they were meant to do - get shock value. Whether these changes were studio decisions, or Villeneuve's, remains to be seen.Had Villeneuve followed his original formula from Dune: Part One into Dune: Part Two, following the narrative from Frank Herbert's original works, I still think this film would have impressed beyond measure. Unfortunately, in its release state, I believe Dune: Part Two fails the audience by robbing them of the true experience that is Dune - the story.This is how I felt leaving the theater; let down. Is it a visually stunning and well executed movie? Yes. Is it true to the source material? No.I leave viewers, enthusiasts, and fans of the original novels a fair observation and warning.

{"id": 94, "title": "This is what cinemas were made for", "content": "Dune: Part Two is the perfect example of a movie that must be seen in the cinema and not at home. The visual spectacle and design is unparalleled among sci-fi and really feels like a completely fleshed out future world (or worlds), with architecture, props and costumes that look like they were sourced from a museum rather than a Hollywood warehouse. Compared to the first film, the stakes have true gravity and the scope is much wider with far-ranging battles and conspiracies. It's hard to pinpoint any highlight as every scene is iconic, incredibly beautiful to behold and accompanied by expertly rousing music, all underscoring the central feeling of foreboding. Where would I begin? The ceremonies with the Water of Life plunge us into an ancient ritual that almost kills the drinker and reveals deep secrets that the audience only finds out in drips. Paul's terrifying vision of death and destruction (much less cheesy than in the first film) show the inner turmoil he faces as someone who is the fulcrum of the planet's destiny and resents his role but can't escape the fate set in motion by higher powers. The short scenes with the foetus are mysterious and tease at an important role to be played by her future version. Chani's frantic misgivings in the Fremen gatherings impress the deleterious effects the prophecies are having on her people and the unprecedented role of the Bene Gessarit. Princess Irulan's musings in a beautiful garden about the historical developments around her uncover just how deeply all the conspiracies extend. The scenes in the Harkonnen's world are stark and show how brutal and power-hungry they are and how formidable they can be. The actors in these scenes are perfectly cast and all impart a sense of heaviness, as if to stress just how much Spice is tied to the fate of the world, the past and the future all together. All of this combines to form an experience that immerses us in a compelling future conflict, relentlessly ratchets up in tension and constantly giving the sense that there's something even more world-shattering just around the corner.That said, the film has a few flaws that are noticeable but not substantial enough to dent my rating of 8.5/10 (rounded to 9). Some of the characterisation is caricatured - the Harkonnens are too cartoonishly evil to be believable (how many times do we need to see them murder their own staff?), Stilgar is too fanatical to be believable (how many times do we need to see him exclaim, \"the prophet! As written!!\"?), the Fremen are too invincible to be believable (did anyone ever doubt how the battles would go?) and the romance between Paul and Chani was forced. The pacing was uneven, as some scenes sped by very quickly (for example, most of the emperor's scenes), and some dragged on for no good reason (most of the times they walk or talk through the desert). Paul would have gone blind by looking directly at a nuclear explosion. The ending felt anticlimactic and was too overt in how it was setting up another sequel. Some parts of the book that are crucial to understanding the planet's history were excised, like the long-term human genetic plan and the ecological plan, which were reduced to one-line mentions. Finally, as a vexillologist, I couldn't help but notice how badly designed the flags were. One of the key principles of good flag design is simplicity, as a simple design can be recognised and remembered at a distance and when waving. Each faction has a central symbol, but their flags drown them out in a mess of visual detail, hamstringing their ability to signal at a distance and establish themselves in the audience's mind. This is a shame, as each faction has such a strong visual identity in their settings and costumes, but their symbols are not given the opportunity to shine and become iconic.

Filled with memorable set pieces, noteworthy performances and much to ponder, Dune: Part 2 is an all-round success story that deserves all the praise that is being heaped upon it.5 blue drinks out of 5.Jordan and Eddie (The Movie Guys)", "rating": 10, "sentiment": 1, "date": "3 March 2024", "name": "eddie_baggins"}

This entire movie plays with the thematics of religion and Messiahs arriving to save the wretched. So many visual queues and so many powerful scenes enhance this way of viewing the movie. \"Dune: Part Two\" works for me wonderfully in the continuity of the lore from the first movie, but it sure has its own thematics. It is an epic scale sci-fi movie and a high fantasy world, but its strength lies in the ways everything relates to our world.

So I guess it's rather silly to tell you all to use the restroom before, but learn from my mistakes! Dune Part 2 is mesmerizing, beautiful and heartbreaking all at once.

{"id": 104, "title": "Extremely Lackluster", "content": "\"Dune: Part Two,\" despite its ambitious attempt to continue the epic saga, falls significantly short of the expectations set by its predecessor, leaving much to be desired in both narrative depth and character development. Where Denis Villeneuve's first installment offered a visually stunning and philosophically rich entrance into the universe of Frank Herbert's iconic series, this sequel struggles to maintain that momentum, veering into the realm of cinematic redundancy and superficial spectacle.The film's pacing is one of its most glaring issues. It oscillates between rushed sequences that skim over crucial plot points and tedious stretches where little of consequence happens. This erratic tempo not only disrupts the narrative flow but also undermines the story's emotional weight, leaving the audience disengaged from what should be high-stakes moments.Character development, or the lack thereof, further detracts from the film's appeal. Newcomers to the cast are introduced with great fanfare but are given scant screen time to evolve beyond one-dimensional figures. This oversight is particularly disappointing given the rich backstories and intricate personalities that define Herbert's characters. Even returning characters, who were previously portrayed with depth and complexity, are reduced to mere shadows of their former selves, often acting out of character or being pushed to the sidelines.Visually, \"Dune: Part Two\" continues to impress with its breathtaking landscapes and meticulous attention to detail in costume and production design. However, these aesthetic achievements cannot compensate for the film's narrative shortcomings. The reliance on CGI spectacle over substantive storytelling feels like a missed opportunity to explore the novel's themes of power, ecology, and human nature.Moreover, the script seems to struggle with balancing the source material's dense political intrigue with the need for blockbuster action sequences. As a result, much of the film's potential for thoughtful commentary on imperialism and environmentalism is lost in translation, replaced by generic battle scenes that lack the emotional resonance seen in the first film.In conclusion, \"Dune: Part Two\" is a visually captivating but ultimately unsatisfying continuation of the Dune saga. Its failure to capitalize on the groundwork laid by its predecessor results in a sequel that feels both overloaded and superficial. While die-hard fans may find moments to enjoy, those seeking the depth and nuance of the original will likely be left wanting more. This sequel, unfortunately, suggests that in attempting to broaden its appeal, the franchise has sacrificed the very elements that made it distinctive and compelling in the first place.", "rating": 3, "sentiment": 0, "date": "3 March 2024", "name": "mattstenson"}

Phenomenal cinematography, cast, direction, sets and special effects", "content": "Dune: Part Two is one of the best produced films I have ever seen. The cinematography, casting, direction and special effects are all phenomenal. The filmmakers have paid intricate attention to detail and it shows throughout the movie.The film follows two strong-willed lovers who are among the many fighters on the planet Arrakis. Paul wants to destroy the people who killed his family, but foresees a dangerous future. That same force is messing with his mind and may ruin his plan to save their people.Some of your favorite actors are in Dune: Part Two! The main characters are Paul or Uzul (Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet), Chani (Zendaya), Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson), Stilgar (Javier Bardem), Feyd-Rautha (Austin Butler), Beast Rabban (Dave Bautista) and Emperor (Christopher Walken). The casting is fantastic; each actor compliments their characters beautifully and believably. I felt many emotions while watching it because of the great acting. When Chani is hurt by Uzul's sudden change of mind, the air feels tense and her anger is shown. Also, Uzul's mom, Jessica, is mysterious and changes her personality when she drinks the poison. This film is so well-produced. I am beyond amazed by the quality of the production. The camerawork captures the scenes so well, especially when they are in the desert. The special effects are mind-blowing, like when Uzul and Chani blow up multiple helicopters. The machine they are running from looks incredibly realistic and threatening. When Uzul has visions, the special effects are well-displayed. We learn that, by consuming Spice, the people on Arrakis can see the future. You know when they are seeing the future because their eyes turn blue. This film exceeds all my expectations and explores science fiction beautifully. The pacing is perhaps a bit off, but you might expect some slow parts since it is nearly three hours long! A lot of hard work went into creating this film. I highly recommend watching Dune: Part One to understand the concepts, the characters and their backstories. Dune: Part 2 picks up right where Dune: Part One left off. These two films really bring the Dune books to life. I applaud the director, Denis Villeneuve, for creating such admirable work. My favorite part of the film is when Paul (or Uzul) learns to ride a huge sandworm. The special effects are remarkable because you feel as if you are on the sandworm with him - the wind rushes, the sand flies everywhere, and the motion of the sandworm is smooth. It looks incredibly realistic and it shows how far CGI has come.The film's message is to have hope and to always believe it can happen. Paul's hope carries him throughout his fights and he constantly encourages the others to believe that they can do it. He also tells his mother to not give them false hope over a prophecy.

I say 'Sci-Fi' because it was futuristic i.e 'with greater technology' which (for me) results in 'Sci-Fi'.Dune 2 was immense as an IMAX experience (no doubt). The explosions were awesome etc, however, where Dune 2 disappointed me was:\n(1) the fight scenes\n(2) the bi-polar characters (specifically Bautista)(1) the group fight scenes (army battles etc) and what I'll refer to as the 'choreography' was poor, and you could see the actors waiting to be struck and it looked fake and ruined the credibility.(2) Bautista in Dune 1 was frightening and dark where in Dune 2 he was a blubbering idiot. Also, the role played by Austin was 'okay' but the fact he needed the shield to fight 3 crippled Atreidas was confusing to me cos if Austin's character is such a badass then...?My understanding of what is a 'Sci-Fi' has been changed, and from now on not only does it need 'technology' but also a 'higher level' of intelligence rather than a marketed/portrayed high level of intelligence.Also the element of comedy in Dune 2 (which I like but not in 'Sci-Fi's) made it into an 'Action/Adventure' and there were Indiana Jones vibes in part from the 'Yemen' (sorry, the 'Fremen'). Bardem was a few lines away from saying 'Indy'.In a nutshell Dune 1 was a dark and relatable movie. Spice = Oil etc etc. It was magnificent, and if Dune 1 = Batman Begins then Dune 2 = Batman & Robin.For me this is overrated.

I respect what the director did here; \"Part Two\" felt much more emotive and touching to me than the first part, while still presenting those jaw-dropping cinematic moments (a right-of-passage the main character goes through with a sandworm reminded me of that canyon run scene from \"Top Gun: Maverick\").All in all, this has instantly become the definitive \"Dune\" film adaptation, with or without future movies coming out in the franchise, and I feel lucky to be alive at a time I can see them in the theater.", "rating": 9, "sentiment": 1, "date": "10 March 2024", "name": "ericknromero"}

It was not a film that can stand on its own EVEN with the knowledge you had if you watched the first part.I also felt that this came off intensely slow (not well paced) and overlong. The action would only peak for 10 mins towards the end AND its barely a climax in fact. A lot of the characters in this film are fodder (ie Butler and Pugh) and could have been edited out of it, and it would still make sense. Butler is definitely overhyped for how little/barebone his role is. Zendaya and Chalamet took the biggest chunk of the film but still felt underwritten - that's a testament given how long the film feels. The religious cult storyline faired better but I felt that it could have been more subtle and organically ingrained into the story rather than driven into dialogue.Overall, just not my cup of tea.

The battles in the second part were epic and all of the added stuff of Paul training was a fun experience.

The emotional connection between Paul and Chani, so vital to the story, is completely lacking and unbelievable. The two main characters are good looking enough but has absolutely zero chemistry on screen.I am certain Zendaya is a fine actress in some things, but she has basically 2 facial expressions here, and the one she uses the most is a scowl directed at Paul. I found her to be the worst part of this movie.The final fight scene is short, choppy, and a mess. It felt anticlimactic and unfulfilling\nThe Harkonens are basically reduced to bumbling villainy almost cartoonish. The ending was super abrupt, and was so different from the book that it left me wondering what the filmmakers would do if they want to do a sequel.I want to reiterate that this isn't a bad movie.

Paul insists he;s not the Messiah yet we get a scene straight out of Life of Brian with a gaggle of Fremen giggling as they proclaim him as the Messiah. This is a serious issue though; Chani (Zendaya) and other young Fremen reject the idea of a Messiah as something that holds them back and oppose the more conservative people. Chani still admire Paul though and their relationship flourishes as the narrative unfolds. Lady Jessica (Rebecca Fergusson) becomes Reverend Mother of the Fremen, surviving a grueling, deadly ritual. She heads south to win over the Fundamentalist Fremen to Paul's cause as the Messiah. The Emperor Christopher Walken) also casts a beady eye on Arrakis, his daughter, Princess Irulan (Florence Pugh) however is very much a creature of the Bene Gesserit. The Harkonnens continue to oppress the Fremen but the failure of Glisssu Harkonnen (Dave Bautista) to inflict a telling defeat lead to his replacement by Feyd-Rautha Harkonnen (Austin Butler), Baron Vladimir Harkonnen's (Stellan Skarsg\u00e5rd) youngest nephew and heir (\"na-Baron\") to House Harkonnen. All of these threads eventually entwine as the film heads towards it's conclusion.Great battle scenes which at times reminded me of Lawrence of Arabia as armies on foot clash in great numbers and engage in sword fights. The one to one duels are also captivatingly cruel. The desert is very much a supporting actor as Paul earns his spurs as a Fremen fighter with the help of Chani. The guerrilla tactics of the Fremen are convincingly displayed as they destroy ornithopters and spice gathering machines, The war of the Flea at work. Villenue appears to be drawing analogies as he shows the ornithopters targeting people on the ground and the destruction of a Fremen habitat as collective punishment but make yiur own mind up about that. Butler plays Feyd-Rautha as a murderous sociopath who will do anything to achieve results to please Baron Harkonnen. He kills at will to provide human food for his three cannibal concubines. Too many in the ensemble cast to name them all but some great performances. All in all a triumph, Villenue may not be minded to make any sequels but I hope his directorial baton will be lifted by a suitable successor.

{"id": 121, "title": "Absolutely outstanding!", "content": "I'd suggest revisiting the first movie because this sequel picks up right where we left off in the Dune universe. From the beginning, you're thrust back into the chaotic, unpredictable, and perilous world of Arrakis. The action is swift and meticulously planned, keeping you engaged from start to finish. What I appreciated about the first film carries over seamlessly into the sequel. Despite being a sci-fi movie, it doesn't feel like one; even without the sci-fi action and special effects, it remains a compelling, immersive, and grounded storytelling experience. Clocking in at 2 hours and 40 odd minutes, the movie flies by, with not a single wasted moment. The narrative flows effortlessly, maintaining organized chaos and hitting all the necessary beats along the way. Given that it's a sequel, you might expect a drop-off, but that's simply not the case. Every actor on screen, from Timothy and Zendaya to Josh Brolin and Austin Butler, along with the other talented individuals, delivered exceptional performances. Each of them was on point and effectively brought the story to life. Another standout aspect is Hans Zimmer's score. Each note propels the narrative with intent, effectively enhancing the atmosphere of every scene. Zimmer's mastery is evident in his ability to employ the same theme across various emotional contexts. While we've heard the theme repeatedly, this film allows us to experience it in different emotional nuances, depending on the on-screen events. While it's still early in 2024, this film should definitely be considered an Oscar contender next year. Dune part 2 effectively concludes the first of six books in the expansive Dune saga. Part of me is eager to see the next installment on screen, but if this marks the end, I'm good with that too, considering the saga gets a little weird from here.

Now, after all these years, I'm even more excited for what's to come. Before watching the movie, I read many praising articles and reviews, but none of them could prepare me for the reality of it. Dune Part Two delivers exactly what it promises - a bold adaptation of one of the greatest novels ever written. It's a tragic story of extreme superstitions that can cause even the most pure-hearted leaders to descend into chaos. The film starts with an incredible sequence showcasing the astonishing use of technology by the Harkonnens and the Fremen's insane harmonization with their planet. The Fremen take down their opponents swiftly and unnoticed, leaving a lasting impact on the viewer. The investment into the rest of the film only increases from that moment on. Denis Villeneuve has done it again and this time, he has hit a home run. Collaborating with one of the greatest cinematographers of our generation, Greig Fraser, Denis has produced a monumental piece of cinema. It not only surpasses the previous installment in every aspect but also reinvents science fiction itself. With its skillful use of practical sets, lighting, and digitized effects, this modern cinema masterpiece serves as a definitive masterclass for anyone aspiring to be a great filmmaker. Although the visual and audio effects in the movie are impressive, they do not distract from its main focus, which is the storytelling. The film follows a love story that defies all odds, as Paul assumes the role of the Messiah, Chani struggles to keep her mind clear of myths and falls in love with someone who is lost not only in the desert but in his heart as well. In the first act, Paul's character undergoes significant changes. He tries to distance himself from his mother's actions by joining the Fremen's cause to liberate their planet from tyranny. However, he remains unaware that Jessica's plan is already in progress. Despite this, the first act remains a charming distraction from these developments. The empire is in a state of despair as the Fremen successfully destroy the Harkonnen spice reserves one by one. This has pushed the Bene Gesserit to their limits, and as a result, the Baron has deployed his most valuable weapon, Feyd Rautha. The second act of the story mainly focuses on how to introduce a villain and make him memorable. And to top it all off, Denis created perhaps the greatest third act in existence. In the end, Paul finally realizes what he has to do. He takes the Water of Life and opens his mind to such an extent that he becomes aware of the destruction he is about to cause, but proceeds anyway. By doing so, he loses his one true love, yet he stands his ground in an incredible hand-to-hand combat and eventually to a holy war with him as an Emperor. Once again, Hans Zimmer's astonishing otherworldly soundtrack elevates this cinematic experience to uncharted hype territories.

{"id": 130, "title": "Dune: Part Two - A Cinematic Triumph", "content": "Having just experienced \"Dune: Part Two,\" I'm utterly convinced that it stands among the greatest films ever created. Denis Villeneuve has delivered a follow-up that amplifies every breathtaking aspect of its predecessor.The sheer scope of this movie is awe-inspiring. The world of Arrakis unfolds with such meticulous detail and grand scale that you feel fully immersed in this alien yet starkly beautiful setting. The visual effects are nothing short of mind-blowing; from the majesty of the colossal sandworms to the intricate spectacle of futuristic battles, each frame is a masterclass in cinematic artistry.But it's not just a visual feast. The story in \"Part Two\" takes a bolder, more complex turn. The political intrigue intensifies, the stakes feel impossibly high, and the depths of Paul Atreides' destiny are plumbed in ways that are both thrilling and deeply thought-provoking. While the film is grand and epic, it skillfully balances spectacle with profound character moments and a plot laden with themes of prophecy, power, and the consequences of choice.If you were a fan of the first \"Dune,\" prepare to be blown away.

This film is absolutely incredible, it's a masterpiece, a work of art. Besides that I think this is also one of the most important films ever made. It accomplishes so much on so many levels. For example, when was the last time we saw a science-fiction movie with masterclass acting, deep characters, perfect cinematography, immaculate sound design (the list could go on...) and that is adapted from a novel?! But more specifically, I believe this film showed us the true power of CGI and how to use it properly. It was nearly invisible and it blended perfectly with the rest of the footage. Denis Villeneuve just took us somewhere no one had never been and it truly is an undescribable experience. He made a perfect use of wide shots, lenses and filters. Adding to that is the immaculate sound design. Hans Zimmer yet again makes an incredible original score and Villeneuve compliments it with the perfect background noises. One thing is for sure though, this is a movie to see in theatre. For me, this was the best theatre experience ever. So if you can go see it I highly recommend to go see it before it leaves to go into streaming.\n                \n                    8 out of 17 found this helpful.\n                        \n                            Was this review helpful?

{"id": 136, "title": "Villenueve's Style and Atmosphere Keeps Part Two Afloat Until the Action Arrives", "content": "When comparing the two entries in the Dune franchise, part of what made the first movie memorable (aside from the world building and moody atmosphere) were the likeable characters fighting for or supporting Paul Atreides. I didn't expect to miss Duncan Idaho, Duke Leto Atreides or Gurney Halleck (who reappears but with a different attitude and demeanor) as much as I did. We get more time with members of the Fremen, including Chani and Stilgar but I didn't find them as engaging or I didn't want to follow them as much (more on Chani and Paul later). The interactions between the Fremen and the remainder of the Atreides clan start to fall into a pattern quickly and while I was intrigued to see how easily Paul and Lady Jessica would assimilate into the tribe, it takes a while for the Harkonnen's to start making moves and the pontificating about the nature of power and church vs state with the Emperor and Princess Irulan also got a little tedious.Dune's hero Paul Atreides is once again played by Timothee Chalamet. Timothee slips back into this role like a glove and he does a good job of showing Paul's conflict over having to grow into what has been foretold for him. The character is a little darker and a little less aloof in Part Two and Chalamet shifts his performance to compensate. Zendaya is also appropriately fierce as Chani. She plays her character as guarded, Chani's skeptical of the legend surrounding Paul and annoyed Stilgar and his brethren are so quick to declare Paul the Lisan al Gaib. She eventually gets into Chani's vulnerabilities and does what she can to sell the bond between her and Timothee's characters. Rebecca Ferguson returns as Paul's mother, the Lady Jessica Atreides. I've always thought Rebecca was an underrated talent and Ferguson brings some coyness to Jessica when she's trying to convince the Fremen of Paul's power but she flips the switch and becomes ruthless to see Jessica's plan through. Of the newer additions to the cast, Austin Butler was my favourite as the brutal Feyd-Rautha Harkonnen. His impression of Stellan Skarsgard's voice slips here and there but he's good at playing the savage and angry champion of the Harkonnens and he has a strong screen presence when he's vanquishing or intimidating his enemies. Javier Bardem is also good as Stilgar but I couldn't get past some of the parallels between his character and similar characters from other Sci-Fi franchises. His character is a little one note and while that's not Javier's fault, it did distract me a little.Even when Dune is meandering through Paul's journey in the early sections, you can't help but be impressed with how engaging the film is through just the visuals and the world building. We are reminded throughout Dune: Part Two how dangerous the planet of Arrakis and how difficult it can be to survive in the wild. This is captured beautifully through the long and contemplative shots of the desert environment and you can see how much care went into making everything looked lived in yet arresting all the same. I also have to compliment Villeneuve and his team for the action in the movie. While the amount of time between set pieces can drag, the film delivered what I wanted. The battles and the ending fight are full of tension and got my pulse racing a little. The choreography is tight and the action looks good and fits in with the tone.Dune looks impressive, they've cast the movie well and I wanted to know where the story was going to go. The biggest problem I had with Part Two was how slow the 1st half of the movie was. It also became a little formulaic, Paul is presented with a challenge to join the Fremen, no one believes he can do it, he does it, rinse and repeat. It never fully bored me but I was checking my phone. The budding romance between Paul and Chani also didn't completely work for me. Chani is mean-mugging Paul in the early going despite the fact he's smitten with her almost immediately. She flips opinions on him pretty quickly and when they're vowing to stay and protect each other, it was a bit of a tonal shift. I thought the two actors did what they could, I attribute it more to the script and possibly the edit. I also have to both commend and criticize Dune: Part Two for not making an effort to catch people up at all. It was a confident choice but I felt bad for anyone who hadn't seen the 1st entry, there's not going to be an opportunity to catch up.I can see why everyone is so excited about the future of the Dune franchise and I did like this movie quite a bit. Part One has a small edge over Part Two for me but I get why Part Two has been so successful. It looks gorgeous, the cast gets the job done and there's a story here that justifies a multi-film franchise. I hope there's not a huge gap between entries and with how things finished in Part Two, we should be in for a crazy Part Three.", "rating": 8, "sentiment": 1, "date": "10 March 2024", "name": "CANpatbuck3664"}
{"id": 137, "title": "Powerful, visceral filmmaking", "content": "This was an utterly fabulous cinematic and spiritual experience. I was drawn into Villeneuve's world by the enormous scale of the design, the undeniable pull of a religious fable, the conviction of the lead players and the power of the sound and visual design.It's strange how often critics (pro or amateur) think that sound and visuals are somehow a mere adjunct to the story; that celebrity actors must all have something worthy to do (cameos are derided); that the politics of casting must be taken into account; that all old stories must have a modern take to make them relevant.Cinema IS moving pictures, and whilst sound is not a requirement, even \"silent\" era classics made good use of music and effects. Story is important, but cinema's unique power is its capacity to move an audience by engaging two of our senses in a most primeval way. Story alone cannot do this.Admittedly, one's hearing does feel at risk at times, but without the awesome sound design, Dune: Part Two would be diminished. I was emotionally overwhelmed by the power of the movie's visceral delivery. This was not some sentimental response to the tale, but a gut reaction to the physical transmission of the themes of power, corruption, revenge, faith, identity - the spiritual battle of Good and Evil. These were, for me, of greater significance than the mere political struggle between the two Houses and the Emperor., which is, in any case, subordinate to the power wielded by the Benegesserit which the Reverend Mothers themselves recognise is not supreme.However, if you want to see parallels with contemporary issues such as the problems of living in a post-imperial world, they are still very visible, and the \"romance\" between Paul and Chani is not a romance at all, burdened as it is with the visions and portents of a Messianic future.I should add that I am neither a fan of the books, having read barely 100 pages of the first, nor, as an atheist, do I adhere to any religious faith. I am, however, a believer in the power of cinema.", "rating": 10, "sentiment": 1, "date": "2 March 2024", "name": "Sandy-99"}
{"id": 138, "title": "Monumental; the apotheosis of picture-making", "content": "Dune: Part Two has been universally hailed as a sequel worthy of Terminator: Judgment Day, The Godfather Part II, and The Empire Strikes Back; a bonafide epic yielding additional comparisons to Ben-Hur and Lawrence of Arabia; a picture that solidifies Denis Villeneuve as one of the modern titans of the art form. Even those who weren't so hot on the first film, finding its characters monotonous and its visuals largely dull, seem to have been thoroughly won over.And although I enjoyed the visuals and thought there was a purpose to their occasional drabness (imposing brutalist structures towering over nature), the new film indeed cranks the art direction up to eleven, exemplifying some of the most potent visuals in sci-fi history. Although I thought the characters worked fine in the original, in the sequel we're treated to powerhouse newcomers and darker depths to the figures we know -- when critics said \"I liked Dune: Part One just fine, but I just can't buy Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet as the hero\", readers of the Frank Herbert novel snickered (in Part Two, new fans will see why).If nothing else, they find that the whole thing feels more complete (recall that the first movie bamboozled many who hadn't a clue it was just \"Part One\"). Frank Herbert's son, Brian, wrote \"When the new movie is combined with Dune: Part One it is by far the best film interpretation of Dune that has ever been done\".Other things that are expanded on and/or elevated include the performances of Zendaya (one of the most expressive and loveable actors of her generation, underused in the prior movie) as Chani, the young Fremen warrior who welcomed Paul Atreides into their camps after the fall of his \"House\", and Rebecca Ferguson as Lady Jessica, Paul's mother who becomes the \"Reverend Mother\" of the Fremen, who believe she and Paul are instrumental to a prophecy of a mother and child sent to reclaim Planet Arrakis from oppression -- the Imperial spice-mining colonies that now belong to the vile Harkonnen family. On that note, we also get a better look at the Harkonnen homeworld, whose \"black sun\" seems to erase all color from it, bar the blackest of black and whitest of white.This moment is one of many reasons you need to see this in a theater. I cannot stress it enough. These sequences -- from the most thunderous battles and Sandworm rides to the intimate final duel that left my audience at the edge of their seats -- are paralyzing to behold in an auditorium, complete with music and sound design that seem to make the very Earth tremble (then falling dead silent at pivotal moments), all sublimely photographed by \"swirly bokeh\" extraordinaire Greig Fraser. (It's not often you see a film and just know you're witnessing the creation of \"iconic\" images.) The action scenes are elevated by impressive choreography and, of course, the performances.The most intense of the new faces is undoubtedly Austin Butler as Feyd Rautha (that's the Sting character in the 1984 movie, in case you needed the reference), lauded by many as the best villain performance since Anton Chigurh and Ledger's Joker. Additional newcomers include Florence Pugh as Princess Irulan, L\u00e9a Seydoux as Lady Fenring of the \"Bene Gesseret\" priestesses, and Christopher Walken as Emperor Shaddam IV.Returning actors include Javier Bardem as the Fremen leader Stilgar, whose incorrigible fanaticism gets some big laughs; Josh Brolin as Gurney Halleck, who is out for Harkonnen blood; Stellan Skarsg\u00e5rd as the revolting Baron Harkonnen; Dave Bautista as The Beast Rabban, who envies the affection the Baron shows toward Feyd; and Charlotte Rampling as the Imperial Reverend Mother, who hatches schemes of her own. Certain characters I've mentioned are given just a few minutes of screen time, yet they all make a considerable impact, from the memorable line reads to the looks that speak even louder, most notably during that final exchange of haunting glances between Paul, Chani, and the Princess.At the center is Chalamet as Paul \"Muad'Dib\" Atreides -- a performance that will vindicate his stans and make non-believers hopefully realize not only how formidable he can be, but what he was truly going for in Part One. Chalamet is known for his thin frame and his friendly demeanor; yet, we have absolutely no trouble believing that his Paul would be a master of sparring and a conqueror of Sandworms. As I wrote earlier, those who judged the first movie by how well his story works as a garden-variety \"Hero's Journey\" are bound to have an \"oh\" moment or two.If you're still worried that some of these elements seem lifted from other works, recall that Dune is (likely) an older series than whatever you're thinking of. All the same, even the familiar images feel new here -- epic in scale in a way that cinema hasn't been able to achieve until now. This movie is a close-to-perfect marriage of hitherto unthinkable technology and a crystal-clear vision for said tech to realize. In part, the movie plays as if Villeneuve heard the complaints of the previous film and, as if on a dare, went all the way with his movie magic for the sequel, putting the doubters in their place.Knowing how the books go, I know this franchise is far from done. And despite how long this film was, I never wanted it to end and still crave more, ergo I'm more than stoked to see what Villeneuve does with the rest of Herbert's legendarium and if audiences keep finding resonance in his version of it. The world of Dune is a uniquely well-realized potential future: intimidatingly immense and outlandish on one hand, and dreadfully convincing on the other, showing that Imperialism and colonialism may be alive and well millennia ahead. (Had this film been made with even less studio interference, the parallels between the Fremens' plight and Palestine may have been even more obvious.)The story of Dune Messiah still needs to be adapted and I'm confident that, once Villeneuve shows it to us, the same media illiterates who started posting Film Twitter Takes about how Poor Things approves of misogyny once that film came out on digital won't be taking Paul's \"White Savior\" and Jessica's cultural appropriation at face value -- or so we may hope. An interesting theory from Walter Chaw suggests that the reason so many people keep failing to get the point of Dune -- and Paul Atreides specifically -- is that \"colonialism is so embedded in our value system as manifest destiny\" that it's straight-up impossible for some of us to interpret a figure like this as anything other than a good guy.

{"id": 139, "title": "\"Dune: Part Two\" - A Cinematic Odyssey of Love, Revenge, and Cosmic Destiny\"", "content": "\"Dune: Part Two\" invites audiences into a mesmerizing narrative universe, mixing the stories of love, revenge, and fate of the main protagonist, Paul Atreides. The film emerged not just as a sequel but as an immersive cinematic experience, marrying the incredible visual and deep narrative. The opening scenes alone show the grandeur element of the movie where the vastness of the desert is captured in wide shots and breathtaking cinematography.The combination of the talented Denis Villeneuve as the director and Greig Fraser as the cinematographer becomes apparent and results in a visual masterpiece. The imagery is not just a backdrop but a character in its own right, shaping the emotional landscape of the film. One standout scene unfolds when Paul Atreides, played by the exceptional Timotthe Chalamet, confronts the ruins of his ancestral home. That scene alone serves as a poignant visual metaphor for the shattered remains of the legacy that his family built for decades. Chalamet has proven himself to be an actor with depth and serious talent that transcends across the big screen. Chalamet masterfully navigates his character's journey from vulnerability to a determination to reclaim what was lost, setting the tone for the overarching themes of resilience and revenge.The narration of religion becomes palpable in a pivotal scene where Paul grapples with prophetic visions. The sequence masterfully blends visual effects with Hans Zimmer's haunting and captivating score which creates an atmosphere that is fueled with mysticism. The film effectively balances organized religion with an exploration of mystical elements embedded in Frank Herbert's material. One of the film's most visually arresting moments occurs during a Fremen sandworm hunt. The usage of CGI effects is a testament to the film's commitment to pushing the boundaries of visual storytelling. As the movie progresses and the characters navigate through the desert terrain, each frame not only showcases the film's technical achievement but also propels the narrative forward, underscoring the symbiotic relationship between spectacle and powerful storytelling.One of the highlights of the movie is Rebecca Ferguson's portrayal of Lady Jessica which contributes a layer of complexity to the story. In one particular scene where she imparts wisdom to Paul, Ferguson infuses the character with such maternal gravity that adds layers and depth to their relationship. Her nuanced performance coupled with the rich character development, anchor the film in emotional authenticity. Javier Bardem and Dave Bautista also deliver a memorable performance as Stilgar and Rabban, respectively. In a scene where Stilgar confronts Paul about his intentions with the Fremen, Bardem's commanding presence underscores the tension between the native inhabitants and the newcomers. Bautista's Rabban, a brutal enforcer, exudes menace, creating a palpable sense of threat that permeates the narrative.Austin Butler, Florence Pugh, Josh Brolin, and Charlotte Rampling, contributed to the film's complex story. With their performances that are convincing and commanding, some scenes featuring their characters added layers to the story which resulted in a web of relationships that enriches the narrative.The richness of the movie's theme extends to a sequence that explores the balance of romance and broader narrative. As Paul and Chani, played wonderfully by Zendaya, unfold and navigate through their relationship, explore the film's complexities of love amidst a backdrop of political intrigue and impending war. The romance, initially presented as the focal, seamlessly marries with the overarching themes of religion and fate.The culmination of these narrative threads is evident in climactic battle scenes that pit Fremen against formidable adversaries. The scene choreography of the action sequences, accompanied by the film's impeccable visuals, results in a visceral and intense cinematic experience. The stakes are high, and the film successfully maintains tension without sacrificing its commitment to visual grandeur. The combination of visuals and storytelling is perhaps the most evident in a scene where Paul faces a moral dilemma. The interplay of light and shadow, coupled with Zimmer's evocative score, added the emotional weight of the moment. The film's ability to balance spectacle with substance underscores its place not only as a visual feast but also as a powerhouse in storytelling.As the film progresses, the story embraces the philosophical underpinnings of Herbert's source material. In a scene where Paul contemplates his role as a potential messiah, the film delves into questions of destiny, free will, and the consequences of wielding immense power. This exploration adds intellectual depth to the narrative, inviting audiences to ponder the implications of Paul's journey. The film's final act also delivers a direct resolution that is both satisfying and open-ended. As Paul fights with the consequences of his choices, the movie leaves room for contemplation. In a scene where Paul confronts the complexities of leadership, Timothee Chalamet's performance captures the weight of his character's innate responsibility.In conclusion, \"Dune: Part Two\" transcends the confines of traditional sequels, standing as a testament to the potential of cinema as an art form. The marriage of breathtaking visuals, masterful storytelling, and nuanced performances creates a cinematic experience that resonates on multiple levels. The film's exploration of love, revenge, religion, and destiny unfolds within a visual landscape that is as captivating as it is thought-provoking. Denis Villeneuve's magnum opus, \"Dune: Part Two\" sets a new standard for cinematic excellence, leaving an enduring legacy in the annals of film history.", "rating": 10, "sentiment": 1, "date": "1 March 2024", "name": "jaysonpajaronvistal"}

{"id": 143, "title": "A Superb Narrative That Eventually Loses Rhythm", "content": "By Ian Chandler - March 11, 2024Dune: Part Two is a largely remarkable sci-fi spectacle that benefits greatly from the buildup of its fantastic predecessor. Continuing almost directly after the first part, the film reinvites viewers to the atmospheric, entrancing world of Arrakis in the shoes of Paul, now accompanied with the Fremen. Also complementing the film is the score. This soundtrack, composed by Hans Zimmer, enhances the film's overall mood; even so, it is not a particularly memorable one. The cinematography is one of the picture's greatest highlights, providing stunning visuals that are certainly going to be on display for those 8K televisions on sale. The first act is mysterious and tense. The set pieces and plot points are both otherworldly and eerie. It glues one's eyes to the screen, and refuses to let them go.Character development is a large focus throughout the film and the world of Arrakis is further explored. Timothee Chalamet is talented in the lead role, giving in convincing emotion without going overboard. Zendaya plays the role of Chani, though her portrayal here is similar to another character she played, Michelle Watson. Several other A-list actors light the screen as well. Austin Butler in particular does a phenomenal job as an incredibly frightening villain. Stellan Skarsg\u00e5rd's talent as the Baron also returns, with the same sinister energy found in the preceding film. The remaining actors do a well job at their roles, but are lacking in screen time to give too much of an impression.With the above-average acting, the appropriate score, and the exceptional cinematography, the first two hours are excellent! The last thirty minutes, unfortunately, are a weak point. The pacing is thrice in speed and unspecified aspects feel lazier than they should. This was also a problem in its 1965 source material, and it is a shame to see no improvement in the movie released nearly sixty years after. It is no dealbreaker; even so, it does hamper the film's overall quality by no small margin.Dune: Part Two - 74/100\nThe film is ambitious, atmospheric, and well-acted, but its third act goes at the speed of a bullet train.", "rating": 7, "sentiment": 1, "date": "11 March 2024", "name": "ian-47918"}

When you watch this film, you can really dig into the world, feel it, almost touch it, could I say. It have all of the things we need, tragedy, action, and of course a little bit of humor from time to time. The first film (Dune: Part One) was definitely an overrated average film that I can't say I enjoyed to much. It didn't felt complete, had many lacks and unfinished details in the story, and the action was generally speaking really boring. Now the sequel, was on a way different level, and it's really rare to say that a sequel is better than the original, but in this case it is true. The plot goes straight after the first one, continuing the battle for the injustice of this dark and cruel world. New characters, enemies, secrets to be revealed, and everything has to end with one word: War. I can start to say how much this film feels like reality. In Dune, the people dealing with the problems on their planets, feels exactly how the wars, revolutions and aspects humanity had over centuries. This film couldn't show it any better. Including some real prophecy stuff involved here, I almost felt Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet was the walking Jesus talking for the good, besides that Jesus didn't master martial arts or any fighting technics of some sort\ud83d\ude42 The character development was also a strong part of the plot, and the characters felt much more important to me that before. The first hour of \"Dune: Part Two\" were Paul Atreides was teached the way of being a Fremen (The Desert People) felt almost to me like \"Avatar: The Way of Water\" when the forest people had to learn from the water people to survive in the new place. I felt the reference was strong here, but not if it was a bad thing, of course. Now jumping over to the technicals and camera, that I think carried a big part of the film, really the atmosphere. The camera filming, usage of the shadows and light, as well as the very interesting angles, smooth montage, and epic editing with the amazing music score, couldn't have made it more of a cinematic experience. They had some very interesting ideas of showing things, for example a baby inside a mother's stomach, and such graphic illusion of that I have never seen before. The runtime was good, and I didn't really felt bored, I was entertained all the time, and I can't wait to see the sequel: \"Dune: Part Three\", that will debut after some years.

Now my rating is probably closer to an 8 (which in the way I rate movies on here, is very, very good) but I feel I just need to help settle down this average that is being blown all out of proportion. Don't get me wrong this movie looks and sounds incredible, but that is where the \"incredible\" ends. There are many sound bites and quotes flying around, which we all know are hand-picked or even 'funded' by the studio, that are going to lead you to believe this is the greatest film of all time...(It isn't). Or that Austin Butler has delivered us one of the greatest movie villains of all time...(He hasn't). These are merely part of the sales pitch. Unfortunately, when you deal with a project such as this that already has a massive following from the books there is no middle ground. The fans will destroy the movie or hail it as the greatest adaptation of all time. These fans, that hold the books in such high regard, feel a sense of ownership, as if they are trying to tell the world \"You see, we were right. You all called us nerds or geeks but now look....\" And they will shout longer and louder until everyone else agrees.Like I said, this is a very good movie, but it is merely the middle.. (spoiler alert, there's gonna be another one!) Now unlike maybe The Dark Knight or Empire Strikes back, I don't know if this is something you would just watch randomly a few years on from now. You would have to set aside the time to make a dedicated effort to watch the whole saga. Which for me, removes it from the 'great movie' conversation.A truly great movie should be something you can watch at the drop of a hat, something you can switch on halfway through and be instantly enthralled because you've seen them so many times. I just see that with this movie. Oppenheimer was the same. A fantastic film, but are you gonna stick it on when you've got a few hours to kill, while you wait for your solicitor to get back to you with the news of how much of your pension your soon-to-be ex wife wants in the divorce settlement...? No. You're gonna grab Flight of The Navigator off of the DVD shelf or City Slickers.I digress. In a nutshell - Great visuals, incredible sound, some good performances although a missed opportunity with Butler's \"greatest movie villain of all time\". Pacing was a bit all over the place at times but overall a more than worthwhile next part to the story.

{"id": 150, "title": "Extraordinary filmmaking and most certainly Villeneuve's magnum opus", "content": "The first \"Dune\" was an exceptional film for a largely exposition-based narrative that told half of the story of the main book. It combined the best qualities of both blockbuster spectacle filmmaking and more character driven-style filmmaking for a brilliantly made piece of cinema. But \"Dune\" fans know that the story only gets more compelling as it goes on, and Denis Villeneuve managed to top himself once again. \"Dune: Part Two\" is nothing less than an absolute masterpiece that not only manages to top the first installment in just about every way.The film picks up pretty much exactly where the first film left off, where Paul has just joined the Fremen to try to fulfill his ultimate goal to defeat the Harkonnens and bring peace to Arrakis. As can be expected, the performances are uniformly excellent among the large ensemble cast, and most characters that were in both this film and its predecessor improve on their performance and its character arc and associated range in comparison to the previous film. Timothee Chalamet is gripping as Paul, showing a dynamic emotional core. The same can be said for Zendaya as Chani and Rebecca Ferguson as Jessica. Austin Butler is chillingly menacing as the vicious Feyd-Rautha. The film is absolutely impeccable from an aesthetic standpoint, from the cinematography to Hans Zimmer's score to the superbly detailed production design based on Fremen culture. Scenes such as Paul riding a sandworm are simply awe-inspiring on an excellent premium large format screen. But the most important thing is that the film is so in tune to the themes and character arcs unique to the second half of the story, particularly Paul's insistence that he is a messianic figure, Jessica's support of that notion in large part due to her Bene Gesserit ways, and Chani's refusal of that view and her independence while still being loyal to the Fremen at large. Villeneuve has always been an insightful and character-driven storyteller first through the lens of science fiction, and the nuanced portrayal of those themes is what elevates this film to the next level. Perfectly paced at 2 hours and 46 minutes, the film does an excellent job at portraying the complexity of the book and its characters; and I generally thought that the changes made from the book (and there are a few notable ones) served their purposes and ultimately still contributed to an outstanding film.Like the very best films, \"Dune: Part Two\" further broadens our horizons as to what cinema can be. In this case, it does so by showing that blockbuster sequels can be exceptionally dedicated to thoughtful thematic complexity complemented by thorough character development. These elements contribute so much to the film as a whole, and help make it an unforgettable cinematic experience.Not to be missed. 10/10.Note: I saw the film in Dolby Cinema, and as can be expected, the picture and sound quality were both superb.

{"id": 151, "title": "Stylish and loud, but very little substance", "content": "Dune, part two definitely is impressive visually with a great musical score. The sound effects alone are remarkable and very loud specially watching it at Dolby Theatre.And that's about it, really! The overall plot was lacking big time, without spoiling anything its strongly based on prophecy and leadership, it's very similar to many of the well known historical stories of prophets and their messages, their rise to leadership and power. Unlike history however, the story buildup is weak, the script lacks originality and the whole ( he is the one ! ) scenario have been utilized so many times in films ( for eg, the Matrix ).There are no high stakes, whether or not the protagonist is the One has no major consequences or at least the script failed to highlight it.The movie still has some very solid moments, like the introduction of the main villain with the black and white scenes is fantastic. In fact, the scenes with Villains were more amusing than the protagonists.Acting is decent but nothing spectacular, Zendaya has basically the same angry impression throughout without any clear reason why. She needs to train and work harder on her skills.Timothee Chalamant, is slightly better, but not very impressive. Dave Bautista is under utilized and both his character and Chalamant's scream too much, it's distracting.Speaking of loud, there was also plenty of shouting from the villagers ( i think they are called Fremen ), chanting words like Lasan Algaib and Modeb, these two words probably consumed half the script, repeated over and over, it is exhausting.I know the director wanted to reflect some authenticity with the languages, but the frequent shifting between English and Fremen or whatever its called was another distraction.Probably the chemistry between Zendaya and Chalamant are the worst I've ever seen, i am not sure if its their acting or the script, but it felt forced and predictable.As mentioned earlier, musical score and sounds effects are the highlight of the movie, superb and transfers you into the film as if we are in it. Same with the visuals, the color gradient and atmosphere sucks you into the world of Dune, its such an experience! But after a while, one wants a story arc to keep ones interest high, which lacked.I would probably say the costume design department is the best, definitely impressive style and unique costume designs for almost all characters, could be nominated for best costume design.Action scenes were loud and impressive but lacked tension because as I mentioned there are no high stakes for our protagonist losing. Not to mention, battle scenes are brief and felt rushed. I was expecting epic battles with strategies and action sequences, something like Star Wars or Lord of the Rings, but there is no emphasis or focus on the battle scenes, specifically the final battle scene.So yeah, it is ok with some memorable scenes, but left me generally disappointed and I think its over hyped, I do recall liking the first movie more. It could have at least be shorter than 2 hours 45 minutes or some better choreography and tension in battles scenes.

{"id": 152, "title": "One of the best science fiction movies ever made", "content": "Dune: Part Two is a masterpiece, there is no doubt about it. This movie is masterfully: directed, written, acted, shot, edited, scored, with some of the best visual effects I've ever seen in a movie. Movies like this are extremely rare these dayss. With the industry riddled with ridiculous superhero movies, (not all of them, but most) and bland, heartless remakes.Dune 2 takes everything that made the first one great, and turned it up to 100. I watched the first one just before this movie, and when viewed together, you have one of the greatest science fiction movies ever made, and one of the best movies in 20 years. There is very little to fault about this masterpiece of cinema.First of all I want to show respect to the cast. Every single actor gives a remarkable performance, with the clear standout being Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet. I wasn't sure that he could pull off such a heroic character, since the actor doesn't scream action star. He was great in the first movie as this young noble, but by god does he prove me wrong. Timoth\u00e9e is outstanding in Part 2. I would say his performance is award worthy. I wouldn't be surpirsed if Paul Atreides is classed as one of the best protagonist of the 2000s, and that is mostly owed by Chalamet's acting.Everyone else does a fantastic job as well, from Rebecca Ferguson's sneaky Jessica, to Austin Butler's sinister Feyd-Rautha. Austin was so good as the villain that I could see him play a bada** Sith Lord in a Star Wars project. Some actors are pretty pointless though, which does highlight some of the minor issues I have. Christopher Walken is almost non-existant here, with his Emperor being pretty bland. He rarely says anything, and has very little screen-time, the same with Florence Pugh, but if there is a sequel (I'm hoping there will be) I'm sure they will both have a better chance to shine.Zendaya is also great here as well. She has proven herself a great actress, just see her acting in Euphoria. Her on-screen chemistry with Timoth\u00e9e is really good, and realistic. It didn't feel forced, or cringe, which is rare in these type of movies. I have seen some complain about her, with the difference between the movie and book counterpart. But I have not read the books, so I am judging from a cinemagoer, and I thought she was great.With the acting aside, my biggest praise is on the technical side. The visual effects are flawless. There wasn't a single frame that stuck out as bad CGI. Everything looked perfect, and that is all due to the breathtaking cinematography by Greig Fraser. The shots and lightning are mindblowing. This is cinema. This is what movies should be.Like the first one, Hans Zimmer's soundtrack is perfect, and his booming score really elevates the action scenes.The action scenes are really well done. There are no stupid shaky cams, or over useage of close-ups. However, despite the final battle being remarkable, I would give a minor complaint in that it was a little shorter than I would have liked, but this can be ignored, since it was so well done, it had you wanting more. Which brings me to the editing. Wow. Not many people praise editors enough, and Joe Walker deserves all your praise. His editing on Part 1 was great, and he is even better here. This movie flows flawlessly, and not once did I feel bored, not once did Part 2 grind to a halt, not once did the shots seem choppy. The last time a movie managed to make a film with this runtime fun and quick, was Lord of the Rings.Denis Villeneuve has left his mark as one of the best directors in the buisness. Some are calling him the heir to Ridley Scott, and he most certinally is... well the Ridley from around 20 years ago. I can't wait to see what this guy does with future movies.Sorry about the long review guys, I just had to get this out my system after viewing this epic in IMAX.

Giant sand monsters have never felt more menacing, and explosive action scenes never more raw. The CGI is exquisite. Never once do any of the alien worlds presented feel artificial.

Making a book-accurate Alia had the potential to ruin the tone of the entire movie.

Under Rabban (Dave Bautista) though they are unable to quell the attacks of the Fremen, which causes the Baron (Stellan Skarsgard) to replace him with his psychotic younger brother Feyd-Rautha (Austin Butler). Paul Atreides (Timonthee Chalamet) has joined the Fremen, who come to respect him, but he shies away from the prophecy of him being Kwisatz Haderach as he foresees billions of deaths if he rises to messianic power.I'm in a slightly strange scenario that my only complaint about \"Dune: Part Two\" would be that it feels it's length, but at the same time, I don't want to lose any of it. You have to accept, I think, that it's a long film and adjust your expectations accordingly as whilst it could perhaps have cut scenes to pick up the pace, there are levels of acceptance and plotting that benefit the film. Also because it's really good. It takes its time telling you the now somewhat tragic tale of Paul Atreides' reluctant seduction by power and his sacrifices in order to establish it. It's told as a story about the dangers of fundamentalism, especially when it's clearly told to us that the messiah prophecy is a story implanted by the Bene Gesserit.Visually it's another really strong film from Denis Villeneuve. It's more striking and impressive than some films with similar budgets get close too. The second half is stronger than the first, containing more of the battles with the final assault topping out the Harkonnen attack in Part One.It's great is the top line of the review, and I really hope that Villeneuve gets to conclude the trilogy he wants to make.", "rating": 8, "sentiment": 1, "date": "11 March 2024", "name": "southdavid"}

{"id": 165, "title": "Superb this is the magic of Cinema", "content": "My Review-\nDune: Part Two\nIn Cinemas now\nMy Rating 10/10I checked my 10/10 ratings for Science fiction or futuristic movies or television series and out of 700 reviews Dune Part Two is only the 5th movie in this genre that I really can't fault.I could see where every cent of the estimated USD 190,000,000 that this second instalment of Denis Villeneuve's adaptation of author Frank Herbert's six Dune novels has been spent .Dune Part One had an estimated budget of\nUSD 165,000,000 and World Wide box office gross so far is nearly USD 434,000,000 so hopefully this instalment will be as successful, it certainly deserves to be.Judging from his first two movies in this franchise I expect at least two more Denis Villeneuve movie instalments.I scored Dune 1 a healthy 8 out of 10 in my previous review but I then was a novice Duner however the state of the art technology of Dune 2 as well as the performances impressed me so much .I cannot think of any other movie of the epic futuristic genre that outdoes Dune for spectacle or innovation\nFor instance the inspired monochrome filming of the Feyd- Rautha gladiator battle in the stadium in front of Baron Harkonnen I thought was extraordinary.Of course CGI computer generated imagery is constantly used in all sci fi epics but in Dune Part 2 it seems to blend into reality in Villeneuve's desert world with such beauty and dramatic impact.This movie is a triumph of design by visual-effects supervisor Paul Lambert and the behind the scenes artisans who invented such creations like the dragonfly-inspired ornithopter to the ominous Harkonnen spice harvesters also called crawlers .Then there's the terrifying giant sand worms that live on the desert planet Arrakis whose larvae produce the special spice known as melange.I haven't spent much time on the plot line as readers of the books and viewers of the movie will know that Dune Part 1 left Paul Atreides trying to join the Fremen in an attempt to overthrow The Emperor and bring peace to Arrakis . Paul after surviving the attack from the Harkonnen and Sardaukar is literally left between a rock and a hard place .Dune Part 2 begins with Paul Atreides united with Chani a Fremen woman he falls in love with . He is taught the ways of the Fremen and is eventually accepted by them after passing a deadly initiation .Paul is seeking revenge against the sadistic Harkonnen who murdered his family and after becoming a Leader and prophet among the Fremen is in a powerful position\nto attempt to overthrow the colonising, sadistic Harkonnens . They include the sadistic nephew of the fascist Baron Vladimir Harkonnen a reptilian like villain called Feyd Rautha . Feyd and his uncle both see control of Arrakis as a path to the throne.One of the reasons I give Dune Part 2 a top score is because the entire leading cast as well as the supporting ensemble cast give superb performances.Repeating his role of Paul Atreides is Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet who really is impressive in Dune Part 2 expanding on his character from the first movie I think he as well as thd movie itself may well be a contenders for a Best Picture and Best actor Oscar in 2025.Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet already highly regarded for his acting versatility surprised me again in this movie especially when his character changes dramatically to a leader and prophet after surviving death by poisoning during the dreaded water of life ritual .My prediction is that the Dune movie franchise will do for Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet what the Indiana Jones movie franchise did to propel Harrison Ford to super stardom.Zendaya is also perfectly cast as Paul's romantic interest Chani a female Fremen warrior Chani . Chani is outstanding and the chemistry between this couple is magnetic .The most pleasant surprise for me in this outstanding movie was Austin Butler's performance as a cruel sadistic gladiator and cousin of Baron Harkonnen.I try thought he was great as Elvis but since then in interviews and other roles I doubted he could portray such a cruel and evil character . Of course make up helps a lot but top marks to Austin Butler perhaps a supporting actor nomination next year? There are many impressive performances in Dune 2 including Javier Bardem as Stilgar , Josh Brolin as Gurney Halleck , Charlotte Rampling as Mother Superior and Stellan Skarsg\u00e5rd as Baron Harkonnen.I'm looking forward to seeing more of Florence Pugh as Princess Irulan now betrothed to Paul Atreidis her role will be pivotal in Dune Part 3 which hasn't begun production yet.I've mentioned the cast of Dune Part 2 , the look of Dune Part 2 but for me the sound and the film score of a great film is an important factor to add to the enjoyment of a movie and 2 time Oscar winning composer Hans Zimmer creator of great epic scores like Gladiator and Dunkirk scores returns to continue his musical magic in Dune Part 2.I saw this with movie with 2 friends who love cinema as much as I do on a huge cinema screen as this film should be seen and we unanimously agreed as we sat there watching the closing credits and listening to the wonderful film score that this is a superb film in every way and what the magic of movies is all about .I would be amazed if Dune Part 2 is the end to this franchise it's a wonderful cinema experience I can't recommend it highly enough but don't see it till you have seen Dune Part One.", "rating": 10, "sentiment": 1, "date": "3 March 2024", "name": "tm-sheehan"}

{"id": 167, "title": "One of the Best Films I Have Seen in Years", "content": "I will be pondering this film for many days after this review, but I will give it my best shot for now. For context, I am someone who has never read the source material, never seen the David Lynch adaptation, and never seen the mini-series from the year 2000. I went into Dune: Part One a couple of years ago and the story was completely fresh for me so I loved it, but it also felt slightly unfulfilling. Well, I take that last comment back now, because once I dove into the real meat of the story with Dune: Part Two, this duo of films became one of my favourite sci-fi stories ever. Here is why I found Dune: Part Two to be a genuine masterpiece.Picking up right where the first film leaves off (with a bit of time passing in between), Paul Atreides (Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet) is now living with the Fremen and learning their ways. His mother Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson) being pregnant definitely raises some issues amongst the people, but they believe Paul is their saviour, so they choose to follow him. After having visions throughout the first film of a woman named Chani (Zendaya), they form a bond in this film that seems unbreakable. The Harkonnen family is also not about to slow down and Paul will lead anyone and everyone he has to, to stop this family from succeeding. With the introduction of the Emporer (Christopher Walken) as the man who was truly behind past destruction, this addition made for a far deeper story for me. He doesn't have a lot of screen time, but his presence opened a lot of doors for further storytelling. When it all comes down to it, this is a spiritual, thought-provoking, exciting, and subdued epic sci-fi film that has layers upon layers of storytelling, that's almost too much to get into here.I will say that where the story takes the character of Paul by the end of the film is not what I expected in the least. Once the first act of this film wrapped up, I found myself completely unaware of where the story was going. Again, since I had no prior knowledge of this story, this was unpredictable for me in all the best ways. A couple of surprises and twists absolutely blew me away and had me thinking it's some of the best Blockbuster storytelling I've seen in years. Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet also gives one of the best performances of his career to date here, which just elevated this already incredible story. My only complaint with this film though, is actually also a massive compliment.There are a couple of characters that are introduced in this film that feel so vital to the story coming to an end, that I found myself perplexed why we didn't see them in the first film. With that said, Dune: Part Two doesn't waste a second of its run time in that regard. Characters are introduced, made incredibly important, and performed insanely well, and they help bring the overall story to a close. I may be disappointed that they aren't introduced in the first, director Denis Villeneuve just simply knew what he was doing and my complaint ended up becoming praise.Villeneuve is one of the best directors out there today, without question, and the work he was able to get out of his cast and crew was breathtaking. From jaw-dropping Cinematography by Greig Fraser, to stunning visual effects by hundreds of VFX workers, to the pulse-pounding and goosebump-inducing score, down to the perfect editing and masterful costumes and sets, there's nothing I can complain about. On a technical level, Dune: Part Two is perfection and with a more than satisfying story to go along with that, I just can't remember the last time I watched a movie this good on the big screen, especially on this scale.I could gush about Dune: Part Two for many hours, so I'll just wrap this up by commending this entire cast and crew for creating such a piece of art. This is a remarkable achievement in cinema and it better be recognized at next year's Oscars. I know that releasing a film this early in the year is questionable, but I believe the love this film is getting will propel it forward. My jaw is still on the floor from experiencing this film yesterday and I can't wait to watch it again and let it all sink in. It's not the type of sci-fi film that will be for everyone, but if you've seen the first instalment and at least liked it, I can't see how this would let you down in any way. Dune: Part Two is now playing in theatres and I highly recommend checking out this masterpiece on the biggest screen you can find.", "rating": 10, "sentiment": 1, "date": "3 March 2024", "name": "kjproulx"}
{"id": 168, "title": "Cinema in its glory.", "content": "Dune Part Two is the sequel to the very successful Dune adaptation. The story picks up right where we left off in the first film. Paul Atreides (Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet) and Lady Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson) unite with the Fremen in their quest to avenge their betrayed family. Paul must prove himself as the so called messiah, the \"Lisan al Gaib\", to unite the different Fremen colonies and overthrow the emperor out of power. He alongside Chani (Zendaya), a fierce warrior and ambitious love interest, will be tested by the brutality of the desert and even more brutal Harkonnens.I'll start by saying this surpasses the first film. The depth and weight of the events that are carried out in this sequel are even more intriguing than the first. The first act mainly gives time for Paul and Chani's relationship development. It follows Paul's trials to becoming Fremen (with a particular scene in mind that I won't spoil for you but it involves a sand worm and is one if not my favorite sequence of the entire film). You are also introduced to new characters like the Emperor played by the legendary Christopher Walken and Princess Irulan played by Florence Pugh, who both are excellent in the film. This is only the first act.The Dune films are brought to life by an ensemble of actors who truly give it their all and portray their characters beautifully. Two performances that stood out for me were Javier Bardem and Austin Butler's \"Stilgar\" and \"Feyd-Rautha\". Props to Javier for including here some awesome comedic timing. His subtle nuances give out these wonderful moments for a good laugh, and it works for me so well because it is unexpected. On the other hand, Austin gives this demonic portrayal which gave me a whole new prospective on his cepabilities as an actor, terrifying but amazing.Each character is further explored and given time to shine. If the first film was more about acknowledging the lore of the Dune universe to the viewers, this film is more about our character's development and arcs.The score of this film somehow got even better than the first one. So much emotion and love was given here. Furthermore, I recently found out the cinematographer who worked on both Dune films is the same one who worked on films which I love like \"The Batman\" and \"The Creator\". Greig Fraser's capture of shots in Dune Part Two will blow your mind. Oscar worthy. The shots that stand out for me are the wide shots. They are glorious. With the mixture of a superb soundtrack by the brilliant Hans Zimmer, the angelic beauty of Greig Fraser's shots and of course the direction of Denis Villeneuve, you are left with a masterpiece.This film is truly a triumph of cinema. In all honesty, I would love for them to make a third film and conclude this into a trilogy but I am also good with them leaving it the way it is.

It's perfect. Also the dialogue is just like music to my ears. It's not these washed up forced humor we see in most Marvel/DC movies. This was some intelligent, matured dialogue and I respect them for doing that. One thing I felt wasn't necessary was the fuss between Paul and Chani.

I also swear at some points I could smell the sand that's how immersed I was in this movie.After watching a couple more lower budget type Sci-fi movies lately that are slightly different Sci-fi genre like Synchronic and Freaks (which I enjoyed both a lot) to then go and watch Dune part 2 and just think yeahhhhh this is a whole other level. I think I saw the budget for the new Gladiator was 310 million and Dune part 2 was 190 million. For this to look just as unbelievably amazing as it did with that budget it makes me think what the hell will they do with Gladiator money?I've read the book and loved it, I've seen part 1 and 2 and loved them. Some scenes in part 2 in the movie were so much better than imagined from the book. Any Sci-fi lover that doesn't like this movie I'll be shocked. It's an absolute epic of the genre that I think will be hard to top anytime soon if at all. Everyone needs to see this on the big screen and lose yourself on the planet Dune.Denis Villeneuve has nailed this and might be my favourite creator in the industry at the moment with Nolan. Their tone and styles just extract the unreal I crave from cinema at the moment, hopefully a lot more to come.", "rating": 10, "sentiment": 1, "date": "29 February 2024", "name": "Truedutch"}

It is epic, intense, sometimes dark. It is like Star Wars. If you're a Star Wars fan, you're going to enjoy this film. The fights were epic. The dialogue, acting, cinematography, visual effects, were phenomenal. I've seen it twice in theaters and it's very long but enjoyable, for me the duration of the movie is just 30 minutes.

I can compare pretty well because I watched the first part night before the second part. First half is filled with dialogue, then second half is very rushed. Ironically, I think this movie works much better on small screen than on IMAX, where I saw this. Just because there is so much dialogue and actually not that much of visually impressive scenes which would work better on IMAX.Feels like they used the time in less important places. Sardukan are suddenly poor cannon fodder instead of empires finest fighters. Paul and his savvy mates taking suddenly harvesters with gadgets they just suddenly happen to have. Nothing is explained via moving pictures. Not anything like how they organize the strikes against Harkonen or how they happen to have weapons of different variety and so on. Things just happen. Suddenly just because it's conventional Paul walks to different places without virtually any kind of resistance or drama just so that he can convey some lines which should be meaningful for the viewer. As it was in the first part, they don't really show the view of Harkonens. I liked the dynamic between the Harkonen baron and Rabban in the first movie, even though that they did gave very little of time for that side of the story in the first part, but they give even less time in this movie.I expected at least something to really stand out in a production of this scale but nothing really stands out. Not writing, not actor performances, not music, nothing. The movie is kind of nice to see how things developed from the first part but that's pretty much it.

For those who read the books.First, what happened to the Space Guild Navigators? One of the main plots is that the Space Guild Navigators need spice to fold space and allow travel between the systems. No where to be found in this movie. So, for those who didn't read the books. Spice comes across as a drug used like cocaine in the movie. You have no sense of urgency because if the \"Spice must flow\" is stopped. It's the end of the empire.Second, what a waste of of Christopher Walken. He comes across as the enfeebled emperor of the houses. The urgency for the emperor going to Dune is because he doesn't want Paul to tell the other houses about his betrayal? WHAT? I guess since you didn't bring in the Space Guild Navigators you had to invent another reason? Did Christopher's contract stipulate that he only wears robes or did they run out of money for his costumes? At the end of movie he looks like a homeless person walked on set. What was also missing was the pressure by the Witches and the Space Guild on the emperor to continue with spice production. Christopher was less menacing and more like 'Grandpa' needs to go to the memory care facility.Third, I knew the movie was in trouble when I looked at my watch and realized \"There's only nine minutes left in this move, how are they going to end it?\". I felt the movie was rushed to reach a conclusion and the ending battle was chaotic and short. Chaotic in not a good way. There is a whole scene about 'the atomics' that made me question on why is it in the movie? We are told about the 'atomics', but there is no follow-up to the ending battle. The fierce emperor warriors come across as incompetent wimps. The ending seemed way to rushed. It's less about a powerful emperor and more like 'how did none of the other houses not take him out?'.There are other problems that are pretty minor, like nothing is mentioned at all about the other systems. Like the Mentat's or the planet of machines. Too much time spent on 'Fade' killing people in an Arena, but failing to mention who these characters are. If you hadn't seen the first film, there deaths make no sense. Robands death seemed like an after thought. Like we need to get rid of this character, but the movie is going on too long. But, my primary complaint is the lack of 'Space Guild Navigators\" and why Spice is so important to these people. There seems to be no urgency by any of the characters to make sure \"The Spice Must Flow\". Disappointed.", "rating": 6, "sentiment": 1, "date": "2 March 2024", "name": "hhsdc34"}

{"id": 183, "title": "An absolutely Stellar Sci-Fi film!", "content": "I enjoyed Dune (2021) but it definitely felt like mostly setup and world-building. It even ends right when things are about to get interesting. Does Dune Part 2 deliver on all the setup?Short answer, Yes! The story is incredibly engaging and thought-provoking. What makes Dune so special is that it isn't just a typical revenge or good vs evil or chosen hero-type story. There is more to everything, with very creative dilemmas that our main character has. It does have the typical romance story in the first act but it is handled wonderfully and then used with great effectiveness afterwards. The second and third acts are just phenomenal storytelling. The director, Denis Villeneuve, just pulls you into this world and manages to deliver an emotional rollercoaster experience that will mesmerize you.On that note, every actor is amazing. Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet had to convince the audience that his character was becoming a frightening leader in part 2 and he absolutes excels. Zendaya is great and has excellent chemistry with Timoth\u00e9e which makes their character's romance believable. Javier returns with more of a substantial role and he is magnificent. He provides some levity to a very dark story but does it naturally compared to the forced humour that is thanks to MCU movies. In terms of newcomers, Austin Butler gives a very top-notch psychotic performance as Feyd. He felt like a frightening presence. Additionally, Christopher Walken is a crazy casting for the Emperor but he absolutely works. All the returning actors continue to deliver terrific performances, and newcomers such as Florence are excellent additions.Part 2 also has a lot more action set pieces. These sequences are a lot better than the first movie as they are choreographed and shot more clearly. The 3rd act has a very entertaining sequence and the final fight itself is an epic way to end. Greig Fraser returns as the cinematographer and he might be one of the best since Roger Deakins. Every shot is just beautiful and really captures the world of Dune perfectly. Hans Zimmer also returns and he delivers more or less the same epic music score as the first film. The set design is still gorgeous and the costumes are still as wonderful as ever.I only have minor nitpicks and that is the movie can feel a bit fast at times. This is notable during the first act where it sort of breezes over Paul's initial time with the Fremen. I also kind of wished the Emperor and Princess Irulan had more appearances considering their vital roles. The character Thufir Hawat from Dune (2021) is also nowhere to be seen in part 2 despite his fate being unclear from the first film. I honestly wouldn't have minded if this film had 15 more minutes to add these additional scenes.Overall, it is rare for a sequel to be this good but Dune Part 2 is one of the best sequels. It delivers on everything the first movie setup while also being a stellar Sci-Fi film. Denis Villeneuve is one of my favourite modern directors and I hope he gets to make that final Dune movie that he wants.

{"id": 190, "title": "While things in the first part could come across as a bit long-winded, things in the second part feel a bit rushed.", "content": "Dune Part Two is the sequel to the first Dune film by director Denis Villeneuve, which was released in 2021. Paul Atreides (Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet) has now joined the Fremen group. Here he tries to learn about their customs such as their handling of the sandworms. Paul seeks revenge on the conspirators who destroyed his family. With Chani (Zendaya) at his side, Paul goes into battle against enemy troops who serve the Emperor (Christopher Walken). This sequel, three years later, immediately picks up where the first part ended. This first part was well received by most as an improved start to the film adaptations of the Dune story. Previous film adaptations turned out less well, because the story of the Dune books is quite a large and complicated story. With Denis Villeneuve's first part he managed to properly introduce the Dune world and build it up with the political struggle between the different groups. With this second film he focuses more on the customs and beliefs of the Fremen group, who think they can defeat the enemy through a more religious approach. Furthermore, the relationship between Paul and Chani is also developed a bit more, but there are some rushed moments. However, with this second part, many things have to be explained and built upon, which means that there are some long-winded moments in this second part. Compared to the first part, this second part has more room for action scenes, which increases the pace and tension slightly. Furthermore, it remains more of a political battle between different groups and houses, which fight each other more strategically than really physically. In contrast to the first part, things in this second part feel more rushed. Like the relationship between Paul and Chani. The aspect of the earthworms and how the Fremen handle and ride the creatures is also explained in a somewhat hasty manner, so it is not always clear. Denis Villeneuve once again provides beautiful visual images of the different worlds and areas from the Dune books. Together with photography director Greig Fraser, they ensure that the images appear beautiful, creative and credible. By adapting the Dune story from the first book of the series into two films, Denis Villeneuve has given himself and his cast members more space to make something good and beautiful out of the film adaptation. This also gives the actors more space to develop their characters and evolve with the time they get in the films. Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet is thus given the opportunity to develop his character from an exploring newcomer into someone who tries to avenge the harm done to his family. Furthermore, he tries to be a savior for the different groups and tries to get them back into balance. Compared to the first part, Zendaya is given more time and space in this second part to develop her character more and work on the chemistry and relationship she has with Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet, his character. However, this relationship can seem a bit rushed, which means it cannot always remain so believable for every viewer. Of the new cast members, Austin Butler steals the most scenes as a dangerous warrior of the enemy army, but he and his character could have been given a little more time and development. Other well-known actors such as Josh Brolin, Florence Pugh and Christopher Walken play their roles well and appropriately, but unfortunately do not have such major roles in this second Dune film.", "rating": 6, "sentiment": 1, "date": "3 March 2024", "name": "movieman6-413-929510"}

As epic stories based on a book but condensed for cinema go, it doesn't get much better. Though I've never read any of the books, it's clear many of it's complexities got lost in the transition. It's also clear that this is not a great fit for cinema, if adapted it should be a series.As big budget blockbusters go it's even more impressive as it's both grandiose but still offers some substance.The reason for my low score lies in the fact that this is the middle part of something that might never be finished.The first film was called \"Dune: Part One\". I knew what I was getting into. The \"part one\" portion of the title was clear. So I looked it up and when I read that the first book would be divided into two films and the second of those was going to be released in a month or so I decided to watch it. I was still slightly disappointed at just how abruptly the film ended but I was prepared.The closer I got to the ending of Part Two the more it became apparent something similar was going to happen. And there it was, suddenly the movie ended. I rechecked and indeed I had read it right. Not only was this supposed to be the end of a two-parter but a third movie wasn't announced yet. It's not sure to happen and even if it does, it will be years in the making.I don't know who to blame for this: Director Denis Villeneuve, Warner Bros., Legendary or someone/thing else but one thing is for sure, this whole franchise and whatever future it has will never see a single cent of my money ever again.", "rating": 2, "sentiment": 0, "date": "1 March 2024", "name": "born_naughty"}

And it's just as dreamy yet more ambitious than its predecessor.Dune: Part Two almost feels like a critique of 'The Chosen One' motif of other movies, and shows the 'pros and cons' of being chosen as a supposed saviour in the eyes of desperate people in a desperate world. What happens for those who are not the 'One'? The world around them gets mighty tricky to navigate, and coming to terms with what is to come... is a lot easier said than done.Dune: Part Two is equal parts spectacular and unusually somber with its high-concept sci-fi trappings. I'm just glad the two movies can finally complement each other; there's bound to be fan-edits that make it a five-hour-plus feature (or it could become reality via a Director's Cut or something), and fans are gonna dissect every scene on YouTube videos speculating as to what the future holds for the Dune franchise on-screen. And it's a breed of film which deserves that kind of online speculation because it's rich with world-building and foreshadowing that may surprise us when they make Dune: Messiah as a movie.Sure it's cliche for reviewers to note the Star Wars similarities, but I gotta say that Dune finally becoming a cinematic franchise to compete with it is nothing short of a miracle (even if the book basically willed George Lucas' magnum opus into existence in the first place) that would Frank Herbert proud.Dune: Part Two is a LOT of movie to digest, but it's no slouch. This is what high-concept filmmaking should strive to be; this is how to channel all that money into something that's worth the effort, and it doesn't have contempt for its audience either. Dune: Part Two can send messages to the rest of Hollywood on how to tackle legacy properties well.2024's first sci-fi blockbuster does justice to one of the most important novels ever written, and it raises the bar pressuring Hollywood to get its collective asses into high-gear instead of slouching on so-so productions (looking at you, Madame Web).Dune: Part Two is good stuff. Give it a shot before the spice runs dry at the movies. 5/5 stars.", "rating": 10, "sentiment": 1, "date": "5 March 2024", "name": "Johnny-the-Film-Sentinel-2187"}

I read the books and loved the first movie so I had a feeling I'd like the 2nd film. And I loved it. But what really had me wanting to contribute is the 1 star reviews. I love them so much. So much anger and vitriol over a movie. Everything I loved about this move seems to be what they hate. It was long but thick with character development. The fight scenes were there for the plot only and didn't make me fall asleep to 30 mins of cgi superhero action. Instead it furthers the plot. It wasn't action packed but layers of lore and story building.But the rage from the reviews of slow action, boring characters, \"lame\" sci-fi makes me laugh and worry. This is epic storytelling, not force fed action. You will have to have an attention span that can focus more than a few minutes at a time. If you can break the cycle of needing non stop stimulation and instead melt into a rich deep story with world building and character arch, you don't be disappointed. Obviously not for everyone but what is. But one of the best film (franchises) I've seen in years. Truly hoping to see the full arch of Paul's story with a 3rd.\n                \n                    7 out of 13 found this helpful.\n                        \n                            Was this review helpful?

{"id": 194, "title": "May thy knife chip and shatter..", "content": "The word that will likely be used most often to describe Dune: Part Two is \"massive\". Expect a whole lot of variations on the words \"epic\" and \"spectacle\" too. Whatever big words you apply to the result, Villeneuve undeniably did not approach Frank Herbert's beloved sci-fi novel with modest aspirations. It's his ambition, along with the top tier of behind-the-scenes craftspeople with whom he collaborated, that have paid off in this superior follow-up to the Oscar-winning 2021 film.While the first installment often felt like half a film, Dune: Part Two locates significantly higher stakes on Arrakis, while injecting just enough humor and nuanced themes about power and fanaticism to flavor the old-fashioned storytelling. More than a simple savior or chosen one story, Dune: Part Two is a robust piece of filmmaking, a reminder that this kind of broad-scale blockbuster can be done with artistry and flair.The movie picks up so closely on the heels of the first film that the Fremen are still transporting the body of Jamis (played by Babs Olusanmokun) home after he was bested in the fight with Paul Atreides (portrayed by Timothee Chalamet). After the massacre of House Atreides, Paul chose to go with the Fremen, much to the consternation of his mother Jessica (played by Rebecca Ferguson). Thinking both Paul and Jessica were taken by the desert and all hopped up on violence after destroying the Atreides interlopers, House Harkonnen amplifies its attack on the Fremen, leading to a few remarkably staged battles between the warriors and soldiers.Villeneuve and his team deftly fill the first hour with battle sequences that counter the firepower of the Harkonnen military and the Fremen tribal combatants, who often literally emerge from the earth to destroy them. Bodies fall from the sky as enormous ships burst into flames in a way that feels nearly operatic. Amidst the chaos, Dave Bautista cannily sketches Rabban Harkonnen as a wartime leader who is in way over his bald head, while Stellan Skarsg\u00e5rd leans even harder into a sort of blend between Nosferatu and Jabba the Hutt.As the battle between the Fremen and the Harkonnens for control of Arrakis serves as the backdrop for Dune: Part Two, Paul's arc from nervous young man at the beginning of the first film to potential leader plays out in the foreground. A Fremen tribal leader named Stilgar (portrayed by Javier Bardem) is convinced that Paul Atreides is the chosen one foretold among his people for generations. Even as so much of the mythology points to Paul's savior role, the Emo King tries to blend into the Fremen, forming a relationship with a young warrior named Chani (played by Zendaya). Paul passes the tests put in front of him by the Fremen, takes on the tribal name of Muad'Dib, and vows vengeance against the Harkonnens who were behind his father's death1.Dune: Part Two is not just a sequel; it is a testament to the power of visionary filmmaking. Denis Villeneuve has crafted a work that is epic in scale, yet deeply personal. This film solidifies Dune as a landmark in science fiction cinema, offering a narrative experience that is as intellectually engaging as it is emotionally resonant.As the credits roll, I sit there, spellbound. Dune: Part Two isn't just a movie; it's an experience. It reminds us that power corrupts, that legends are forged in sacrifice, and that love can bloom even in the harshest of landscapes. Villeneuve's direction, combined with breathtaking cinematography and stellar performances, elevates this film beyond mere entertainment.And so, dear reader, I leave you with this: Let the spice flow, let the sandstorms rage, and may your dreams be haunted by sandworms and whispered prophecies. \ud83c\udf1f\ud83c\udf35", "rating": 10, "sentiment": 1, "date": "14 March 2024", "name": "bestvideos"}

Two, of Greig Fraser's incredible photography that pulls you into this awe-inspiring universe filled with themes of colonization, conspiring bloodlines, modern warfare, love & one-upmanship. Three, of a cast that's on its toes when it comes to making their respective characters (protagonists, antagonists, and everyone that comes in between) connect over larger (and smaller) threads of plot, while making us invested in their journeys. Four, of Joe Walker's editing that acts as the binding glue for the film to work as a cohesive whole, connecting it piece by piece, scene by scene. And lastly, I HAVE to mention these names for their commendable contributions to this epic saga: Brad Riker - supervising art director, Patrice Vermette - production designer, Paul Lambert - visual effects supervisor, Gerd Nefzer - special effects supervisor, and Thomas Struthers as stunt coordinator.

It implies to me that the film has prioritised visuals. That it is style over substance. And it almost always turns out to be the case. 'Dune: Part 2' was no exception. If people want to sit there, under the influence of whatever they may choose, and just enjoy a visually spectacular film, good for them. Not me though. I like a film that is willing to go to some unexpected places. That is going to leave you thinking long after you leave the theatre. This film was neither of those things.There's an incredible cast assembled for this movie, however none of them really stand out above the rest. For an almost three hour long movie it feels like most of them get a surprisingly small amount of screen time. Austin Butler was probably the pick of the bunch with a menacing villain performance. On the other hand I really struggle to buy Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet as a bad-ass hero. And could we get subtitles for Javier Bardem? I don't think I understood a single word he said in the film.I will say this one is probably better than 'Dune' (2021) for the simple reason that there actually a couple of decent sequences in the movie here and there. Throughout the 170 minute run time there were a couple of 10 minute sequences where I wasn't completely bored out of my mind. Otherwise though, this was a long and arduous journey to sit through.

Part One was the build up and this is the payoff. It explores the connection between Messianism, religious fundamentalism, politics and militarism in a way that mirrors our own world. But it doesn't offer any easy utopian resolution, completing a hugely satisfying arc in the hero's journey but at the same time presaging an apocalyptic holy war between the Great Families.Every aspect of the film impresses. The design, the costumes, the tech, the music, the combat sequences, and of course the narrative, for which we can thank Frank Herbert but also screenwriters Villeneuve and Jon Spaihts. When Maud'Dib and the Fremen ride on the back of the giant sandworms (Shai-Hulud) you know your watching sequences that will become cinematic classics. Bless the Maker and his water!All of the cast are back from the first film and there are some excellent additions. Christopher Walken is the Emperor and Florence Pugh his daughter Princess Irulan. L\u00e9a Seydoux is great but a little under-utilised as Lady Margot Fenring. The standout addition is Austin Butler, fresh from his portrayal of Elvis, smashing any typecasting to pieces as Feyd-Rautha, the psychotic and sadistic champion of the Sardaukar.One thing I love about both films is that they tell a mother and son tale. Rebecca Ferguson (as Lady Jessica) and Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet (as Paul Atreides) brilliantly explore the negotiated territory between a mother who sees her son in terms of her own prophetic wishes and a son who resists that vision but in the end uses it to carve out his own destiny.If there is one criticism I have (and its only a small irritation) it's the rather poorly rendered mass crowd scenes. They are so obviously computer generated (of course) but they don't look at all real which takes you out of the world you're immersed in. That aside, I have not loved a franchise this much since The Lord of the Rings trilogy, and I definitely want to see it again at the cinema. An IMAX session would be awe inspiring.

At all, except as a fetus who speaks to Jessica. So of course she doesn't kill the Baron. It actually works out. From a filmmaking point, good luck finding a child who could do justice to the role, even if you age her up.Jessica, in my opinion, becomes the villain after drinking the water of life. She essentially manipulates Paul into become the Mahdi. It was previously ambiguous as to her birthing a son, and by extension the Kwizatch Haderach, was due to love or vanity. This would almost now appear to be the latter. Again, just my opinion, but I don't believe the water changed her, more likely it awakened a dormant ambition.Chani is by far the most improved character from the books. With all respect to Frank Herbert, she didn't really do much. She was the love interest and ultimately the mother of the Tyrant and that pretty much sums up her relevance in the Dune Saga. She is still all that of course, but while she loves Paul, she's an outspoken cynic concerning him being a Messiah. This was a welcome change.Stilgar is exactly what he was at the end of the first book but all that throughout. I am mildly disappointed. Nevertheless, he is the most comedic character.Paul kills the Baron. Chani breaks up with him (kinda). The door is wide open for part 3.Those are the most significant changes from the book.

The profound impact of Frank Herbert's epic 1965 science fiction masterpiece on both literature and religion is not to be overshadowed by Denis Villeneuve's visionary homage. This is the book come to life, and if you appreciate the book, the movie should resonate deeply with you.I struggle to think of a better-executed sequel; though 'The Empire Strikes Back' and 'The Dark Knight' are certainly in the running, 'Dune Part Two' excels beyond both. Its strength lies in the combination of jaw-dropping world-building, extraordinary acting, and a script that allows the audio-visual experience to unfold effortlessly. 'Dune' is a spiritual journey deeply rooted in Muslim culture and Western Colonialism's quest for natural resources, which is even more relevant today as it was nearly 50 years ago when the book was written (i.e., \"The Spice,\" which always equated to oil in my mind).Aesthetically, the film has no equal, which is no surprise considering the director's extraordinary track record, including 'Blade Runner 2049', 'Arrival', and 'Sicario', all of which are in my Top 50 films of all time and deserving of a perfect 10/10, along with 'Dune Part One'. 'Dune Part Two' exceeds its predecessor in every way, elevating the story in such climactic fashion that my heart and mind were positively buzzing for a solid 90 minutes. It has no weak link, no tonal inconsistency, and no extended dip in energy or over-explanation in which to lose the viewer. It is a perfect film from my perspective and likely to crack my top 5 all-time (I will reserve final judgment until I can see it in 70mm IMAX next week).", "rating": 10, "sentiment": 1, "date": "1 March 2024", "name": "nordicsoul"}

In short a mirror.Part one superlative,cinematic, a big improvement to lynch's original.However I can't give a 10 to this eagerly awaited part two edition,as the director has changed the original book version somewhat, but all the actors did perform exemplary with what they were given.I didn't like the ending, and the inference of what was to come,after the defeat,it looked like a setup prelude to Messiah,the principle evil characters were dispatched, in a different way to the book,and the benegesserit order,supplanted by Jessica's fremen converts following didn't have the dramatic impact and in the book years passed before the uprising,Paul's character had some important training to go through,and had to prove that he had the heart of a warrior. Also the film portrayed North and South deserts,where there was some division between religious factions and warriors.Also a Big reveal, that the fremen could ride the worms,and before him taking a trip to survive in the desert,and taking the water of life.At this point Stilgar became a bit watered down,and Gurney the smuggler reunited with Paul.....all done within 10 minutes on film.Chani having a hissy fit at the end jarred somewhat. It was accepted that Muad dib would take power and rule for political purposes,and that was implicit in the books,he had already seen his own death in the future. Chani also had three children by him eventually in the books.Christopher Walken,a great actor and thespian,wasted, not given enough coverage,thinly revealed ,not really portrayed as an all powerful Emperor.Timothy Chalamet was probably the only convincing original Paul Atreides,along with the psychotic feyd rautha by Austin Butler.Apparently Chala Mala bing bong is going to do a Bob Dylan biopic...Please...Don't mess that up,while I'm still on the planet..\nI still have the original vinyls,it's Alright Ma..I'm only sighing....What was missing in both films was the power of the landsraad, and guild navigators reliant on spice for utilising foldspace.", "rating": 9, "sentiment": 1, "date": "7 March 2024", "name": "pappywatts"}

I really think this movie is amazing in every aspect.Starting with the world building, this was my favorite aspect from the first movie, and this movie builds further on that in such excellence, and in combination with the astounding cinematography I really felt like I was there on arrakis. You will learn much more about the freman and their ways of life which is fascinating. I'm still in shock and I want to go back.All the performance are also so good. The story builds further on all the old characters who are fleshed out even more with new complex layers to them and the new characters who are also all great, especially Austin Butler! His performance makes his character truely scary, such a good villain. Timothee Chalamet is also great is this movie and really shows the complex things Paul is going thru this movie, which was really cool and even scary sometimes to see unfold. The same goes for all the other actors, I just can't say there was a lesser performance, everyone really gave there all and it shows!Also, the score is (again) incredibly good! Hans Zimmer also builds upon the music he made for the first movie, which results in an even better score which also elevates the movie to an even higher level.In conclusion, this movie is a masterpiece, it starts slower, but that's a good thing. It needs that, so in that way everything keeps building upon each other which eventually explodes in one of the best climaxes I have ever seen! I'm really still in awe, and I could keep talking about how great everything is, but believe me, just watch the movie. Go to the biggest screen you can find and watch it. You will be blown away, this is really one of the best films of the generation. Thank you, Dennis Villeneuve and everyone who worked on this movie, and I'll eagerly be waiting for Dune: Messiah!Long live the fighters!100/100.", "rating": 10, "sentiment": 1, "date": "29 February 2024", "name": "aeneaskokkelmans"}

{"id": 214, "title": "Brilliantly continues this highly engaging story without ever once letting up on what made the preceding film so great in the first place", "content": "\"Dune: Part Two\" is the sequel to the 2021 science fiction film \"Dune\", based on the 1965 novel of the same name by Frank Herbert. Directed and co-written by Denis Villeneuve (\"Incendies\", \"Prisoners\", \"Arrival\", \"Blade Runner 2049\") and starring Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet, Zendaya, and Rebecca Ferguson, it brilliantly continues this highly engaging story without ever once letting up on what made the preceding film so great in the first place.After the fall of House Atreides at the hands of the House Harkonnen, Paul Atreides (Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet) and his mother Lady Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson) find themselves joining up with a native Fremen tribe on the desert planet of Arrakis. In an effort to gain the Fremen's trust, the two undergo a series of challenges, with Paul learning their language and taming the large sandworms, and Jessica drinking from the Water of Life to replace the tribe's dying Reverend Mother. Over time, Paul develops feelings for Chani (Zendaya), a young Fremen woman whom he had been seeing in his visions, and the pair start working together to prevent the Harkonnen from harvesting all of the spice on Arrakis. It soon becomes clear that the Harkonnen will stop at nothing to steal all of Arrakis's most prized resource, and while Paul wrestles with his personal emotions, he plans an effective way to stop them before the entire universe itself is placed in mortal danger.Without any doubt, the 2021 film adaptation of Frank Herbert's first \"Dune\" novel has proven to be one of the most engrossing science fiction movies to be released in the past few decades. Cleverly alluding to the real-world history of trade, this film takes that very concept and places it into a futuristic outer space setting with the underlying social commentary that hostility between different cultures will always remain a problematic concept. Due to the sheer scale of the story being told, it would be impossible to tell this epic tale within the confines of a single film, which resulted in it being split up into two parts. In this long-awaited second half of the story, the plot continues in an incredibly well-made science fiction masterpiece that retains everything great about the original and more.Like its predecessor, this film does a fantastic job of captivating its audience within the first ten minutes and maintaining that level of intrigue the entire way through. We watch as Paul and his mother Jessica work together with their new Fremen allies to overcome a potential ambush from a group of Harkonnen soldiers. Rather than attacking the enemies up close, the Fremen are observed sniping them from a safe distance, using their own wits to dispose of them without drawing too much attention to their location. Later, as Paul and Jessica strive for acceptance among the Fremen, we are shown each of the painstaking ways the pair try to exert themselves to win their favour.Paul's taming of the skyscraper-sized sandworms proves to be a challenging task, but once he masters it, the audience is treated to an incredibly exciting sequence that is certain to leave a lasting impression. This later leads to him bonding with Chani, who admires Paul for his commitment to the right cause and the two start to harbour romantic feelings for each other. On the other hand, Jessica's journey is more of a spiritual one, with her taking on the role of the Fremen's new Reverend Mother. By consuming the mysterious \"Water of Life\", Jessica gains the ability to hear the memories of all her ancestors, allowing her to become an important figure for both her son and the rest of the Fremen. The two contrasting journeys to enlightenment are balanced perfectly alongside each other, allowing for a necessary emotional undercurrent for the thought-provoking themes scattered throughout the main story.We also learn more about the Fremen themselves, whose lifestyles were only hinted at in the first film. Far from the uncivilised \"rats\" that they are labeled as by the Harkonnen, the Fremen are an interesting group of natives who have learned to adapt to the hostile environment of Arrakis and live in harmony with the other dangerous creatures. However, it is also established that there are some disagreements between the Northern and Southern tribes over which lifestyles they should all be following. I interpret this as the film's way of alluding to real world religious disputes over how someone's personal beliefs will always clash with others, which is shown to still be a problem thousands of years in the future.If the story doesn't invest you right away, then the film's amazing visuals are sure to do the trick. All too often, I see films that use CGI as a way to distract the audience from its faults but here it is all implemented flawlessly as a method of advancing the story forward. I often found myself in awe at the fantastic use of cinematography for even the most trivial of scenes. For example, as a way of showing how small the human presence on Arrakis is compared to the planet itself, there are moments where we see the large building settlements being dwarfed by the size of the huge sand hills in the background. And if that isn't enough to get the point across, the even larger sandworms just might pop up from underground to devour anyone or anything unfortunate enough to be in the wrong place at the wrong time.Also, despite being a desert planet, the appearance of Arrakis is never a dull sight. Spice glimmers brightly in the hot sunlight and the film's creative colour palette allow it to effectively reflect the particular mood of a scene that would have otherwise become straining to the eyes. But it's not just Arrakis that is impressive to look at, as there are other locations that brim with visual brilliance as well. The Hardkonnen homeworld of Giedi Prime has noticeable shades of black-and-white that give the planet a militaristic vibe in the vein of a World War II propaganda film, complete with marching soldiers wielding emblematic flags. Additionally, during some sword fights, the film even starts to resemble a classic samurai feature, in particular those by the legendary Akira Kurosawa. Just when I thought I was becoming desensitised to dazzling visual effects, this movie has proven me wrong.But perhaps the best part about all of this is the film's pacing and editing. Even though it clocks in at a whopping 167 minutes, at no point does the film ever drag or contain any unnecessary filler. Director Denis Villeneuve has masterfully used his skills to combine all of the film's aforementioned strengths into a perfectly paced story that is able to simultaneously wow the audience with its great visuals, immerse them in the atmosphere of a faraway planet, and keep them invested in what happens to each of the characters. One scene where this is prominent is during Paul's attempt to tame a sandworm. Here, Paul places a device into the sand that is used to attract them to his location and waits patiently for one to appear. The suspense of whether or not a sandworm is going to suddenly appear out of the ground without warning is so cleverly done that I could not take my eyes off the screen during this whole sequence. There aren't many filmmakers capable of pulling off a scene like this, but Villeneuve is clearly more than qualified in this particular area of expertise.As I said about him in the previous film, Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet is perfect in the role of Paul Atreides, whose importance in the story has increased significantly since last time. Watching Paul grow closer to the Fremen through Chani is a solid emotional anchor for his character, and helps him become more sympathetic to the audience. As Paul learns more about the Fremen, the audience is learning along with him, and the film never skimps on the details regarding what he needs to do to win their trust. Even Paul's character arc is more interesting this time around, as we watch him wrestle with his conflicting emotions and the stoic pragmatism he trained for all his life.Zendaya also stands out as Chani, who has a more prominent supporting role teaching Paul everything he needs to know about her people. Though Chani is more than capable of handling herself in combat, she and Paul nonetheless make a great team together, allowing the two of them to grow closer romantically. Rebecca Ferguson plays a larger role in the story as Lady Jessica, not only as the mother of Paul but also as a new maternal figure among the Fremen. Without revealing any important details, Jessica's character provides an almost supernatural quality to an otherwise grounded story as a result of her consuming the Water of Life.Much like last time, this second part of the story that began with 2021's \"Dune\" has found a way to go all out to entertain its audience at every opportunity. It draws you in with its fantastic visuals, keeps you invested in its intriguing plot, and also provides some insightful commentary on the general nature of human behaviour. This film is an epic in every sense of the word; both in scale and narrative. There are still five other \"Dune\" novels written by Frank Herbert with the potential to be adapted into feature films, so I remain hopeful that this one is not the end. Judging by the success of both this film and its predecessor, there is a bright future ahead of us.I rate it a very high 9.5/10.", "rating": 10, "sentiment": 1, "date": "29 February 2024", "name": "MrDHWong"}
{"id": 215, "title": "Visually Spectacular and Chalamet Captivates", "content": "Dune Part II is visually spectacular and Timothy Chalamet has grown into quite a gifted actor. The worm riding is everything you hoped it would be and there's no way this doesn't win the Oscar for Cinematography and Special Effects and Sound. But the real star of this story is Paul Atreides and our focus rightly stays there. A wonderfully complex character, and any fan of the books knows that Paul is not quite hero, not quite messiah and not quite villian. A tall order for a young actor but Timothy Chalamet \"commands the stage\" and finally someone plays Paul Atreides with the nuance Herbert wrote in him. Credit must go to the director too who clearly guided his actors to find the performance within and most all of the characters live up to Herbert's vision and Villeneuve's interpretation. I say almost because I did not care for the direction they took Chani's character and we are robbed of the years spent together and instead Chani and Paul are reduced to teen angst. Gone is their son and his sister remains unborn forcing us into a very short timeline where we are to believe a LOT happens within the length of a pregnancy. We are robbed of some of the details of Fremen culture but that said, it was still wonderful. I was glad Jamis' wife was written out so there were good changes. Zendaya does a pretty good job and she's charming on screen but this was a pretty flat performance mostly because they didn't allow her to be Chani from the book. I also still don't care for Rebecca Ferguson's Lady Jessica. I loved this actress in White Queen but you can tell she didn't do her research and read the books (as she so often brags on late night TV). To me the character is so much bigger in the books. Ferguson plays her with one note. But back to positive - I loved Javier Bardem as Stilgar although he was arguably a touch too Zealot, Josh Brolin's Gurney Halek was perfection but too little music from him. And Austin Butler's Feyd-Rautha?! What a wonderful surprise! That kid has range! The final knife fight was choreographic beauty.I would give it a 10 but I think they should have spent a little more time on Fremen culture but I suppose a Spice Orgy would be difficult for 2024.

The first Dune movie by Denis Villeneuve is stunning in nearly every way. Sci-fi epics like this are my favorite kinds of movies to watch and I was wondering how this story would go. The trailers looked great, but it did not prepare for the movie I experienced.Very few sequels to movies surpass the original. In my opinion, Dune: Part Two is one of them. This movie is AWESOME! It is rare for a movie's production to draw me into the movie so much that I feel a part of the film, even in theaters, but this is one of those films. The scene that Paul is riding the Sandworm from his perspective has the sand flying in our faces with the sound of the Sandworm traveling through the land sounding like a sandstorm almost. I love these kind of scenes because this is the kind of magic that I look forward to in movies. It felt like I was a part of the experience. That is just one scene of this immersive and enthralling sci-fi epic.The production in this film is nearly flawless. The cinematography by Greig Fraser is some of the most beautiful cinematography I have ever seen period. It is gorgeous and it sets up the dark tone in this movies. The scenes where Feyd is in the arena is magical representing the pure evilness of the Harkonnens. It is such a magnificent scene that stands out in a movie largely set in a desert, but it is just one scene of great cinematography. The desert shots and even a romantic scene with Paul and Chani stand out as well for the clever composition. The visual effects look real, especially the Sandworms, the sets are amazing and the costumes are some of the best I ever seen. I heard Austin Butler was in this movie but I absolutely did not recognize him. He transformed completely in this movie, partially because of the fantastic makeup.The battle scenes are epic and filled with clever tactics. I love how the Fremen can emerge from the sand to take the Harkonnen soldiers down and the scenes where Paul and Chani are fighting together. We get to see how the Fremen slowly get the upper hand on the Harkonnens with the action. The physical fights are even better here than the first movie with the choreography and intensity being on point. The action sequences are all beautifully shot and edited and some of the melee fights standout with how unique they look. The soundtrack is just as great as the first film with musical by Hans Zimmer being haunting at times. This movie has more than a few technical achievements.I love the way the story is told in this movie, it is not anything like I expected it to be. It tackles the messianic figure trope in a fantastic way and it shows why it is not always great for a certain group. Paul Atreides mixes his good intentions with his more ruthless ones and it creates a narrative that is darker than the first movie. The movie progressively gets darker as it starts out optimistic with Paul learning how to ride a Sandworm, fight like the Fremen and connecting with Chani. The last act in this movie is one of the best third acts in a movie I have seen in a long time leading to me feeling a lot of different emotions. I even felt shock through my body in one scene and that rarely ever happens when I see a movie in the theater. The story here is terrific and the direction by Denis Villeneuve is masterful. Villeneuve sets his vision for the movie perfectly and he shows that he is one of the best directors in Hollywood.The performances and characters in this movie are top-notch. The only issue I had with the first Dune is that I felt that Paul Atreides was not the most interesting protagonist. He is so much more intriguing here. He is a better fighter, wiser and a bit more ruthless. He becomes a better leader as well. Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet is phenomenal here. He shows so much range in emotion and fury that I saw his growth as the leader natural. His speeches are amazing and memorable with the emotions he conveys. Zendaya as Chani steals the show. Her facial expressions in the third act show so much emotion and you can tell so much about what she is thinking that it gives her character more depth than she already had. In genuine, Chani is a great character who I rooted for the whole film and Zendaya brings this character to life. I knew Zendaya is talented, but this is without a doubt her best performance I have seen from her. The other allies are awesome as well. Rebecca Ferguson is amazing as Jessica again, Javier Bardem is awesome as Stilgar and Josh Brolin brings the heart as Gurney.You cannot have a great movie without great villains and this movie has some of the most memorable villains I have seen in a while. The Baron is as evil as ever and Stellan Skarsg\u00e5rd is fantastic, but it is his two nephews that standout. Dave Bautista is great as Rabban as he shows a lot of rage, but also some weaknesses that kind break him. However, Austin Butler as Feyd-Rautha steals the show every single time he is on screen. His screen time is a little limited since he makes his debut here, but Butler makes the most of it by transforming into this monstrous guy who loves to fight. His mannerisms, line-delivery and actions are frightening and I was nervous every time he was on screen. Feyd also has a surprising sense of honor in that he is ruthless, but he also respects people who put up a good fight against him, making him more respectable than his brother and uncle. My only minor complaint is that I wish he had a little more screen time just to explore his character a bit more, but this is still one of the best and most memorable villains I have seen in years. Austin Butler is definitely a force to be reckon with between this and Elvis.Dune: Part Two is one of the best sequels I have ever seen. It is also one of the best moviegoing experiences I ever had. I got to see it on a pretty big screen with a pretty packed theater filled with older people and when the movie started, the chatter vanished as the audience became silent for nearly the entire film aside from laughing at a couple of moments of humor. It felt like we were all mesmerized by the film. As soon as the movie, there was some applause and a lot of chitchat about what happened in the movie. It was such a great experience because it feels like the audience was engaged with this movie and I rarely see that with other movies I see in theaters nowadays.I could have watched Dune: Part Two for hours longer. I was never bored or tired in the slightest. I did not want the movie to end. I thought the first movie was fantastic, but this improved on the first in every way in my opinion. This might be my favorite sci-fi blockbuster I have seen in theaters since Edge of Tomorrow. I cannot wait to see the final part of this movie. As someone who has yet to read the novel, I have no idea what direction the last movie will go. As far as the rest of the year goes for film, I think it will be challenging to find a movie I thoroughly enjoyed more than this one.", "rating": 10, "sentiment": 1, "date": "3 March 2024", "name": "jaredkjacoby"}
{"id": 224, "title": "Almost perfect...", "content": "My fresh impressions from the pre-premiere speak of this most hyped piece of the current decade as an accumulation of the very essence of cinematic artistry and a demonstration of original visual spectacle like nothing seen before.Denis Villeneuve's new masterpiece, which many have even dared to call the greatest film of all time, truly justifies such accolades at moments. The direction of some scenes, their scenography, and the mythological monologue accompanied by Timothy Chalamet's incredible performance is something that sent shivers down my entire body as scenes unfolded before my eyes, captivating me in a trance that truly elevates cinematic artistry.Unlike the first part, Part Two is filled with numerous action sequences whose choreography is again something we haven't had the chance to see often. But... Despite all my excitement for the film, and as a big fan of the first part and the book, I must disappointingly say that this is not entirely perfect or the greatest sci-fi film of all time. I wanted the grand final showdown, which was completely neglected in the book's description, to be presented here at a level greater than anything we've seen so far, and, it was close to that, technically very close... but temporally insufficient.In conclusion; \"Dune: Part Two\" is another magnificent masterpiece by Denis Villeneuve in the adaptation of the cult book. A film that truly pushes the boundaries of the genre and something that, if you enjoyed the first part, you must see on the big screen or the largest screen available!\"Long live the fighters!\" 10/10.", "rating": 10, "sentiment": 1, "date": "28 February 2024", "name": "Ernad_Fakic"}

I walked out feeling exactly that. Amazing cinematography, score and stunning performances. Timothee Chalamet, Zendaya and Rebecca Ferguson deserve Oscars.The scenes shot in IR are some of the best cinematography to exist, period. Dune: Part Two captures the essence of the book, and elevates it to an art form that is beautiful, terrifying and utterly breathtaking.There were scenes where the raw power of the film and score led me to tears. This movie deserves Best Picture, and so much more.However, I do have a few gripes. Firstly, the relationship between Paul and Chani was one of calm and trust in the book. Here, it was one of doubt and mistrust. That is a bit sad to see, although it does add significant tension into the relationship, which may become a pivot point in the future.Also, many scenes were omitted, particularly for length decisions. However, not getting to see Hawat, or the decadence of House Corrino and the Golden Line Throne was a bit of a shame.That said, Dune: Part 2 is a work of art.

{"id": 233, "title": "Disappointing", "content": "I loved part one and was really hopeful of a satisfying ending, but was left disappointed.I am a big fan of the book(s) and feel previous attempts at visual interpretations have been underwhelming. The first film changed that. It set the world and characters up thoroughly and steadily. It was long but merited the running time. Part two was a let down.In this film the good work is somewhat wasted. Don't get me wrong this is not a bad film, it just has some problems.Quite long sections were boring. The focus on certain characters and personal issues were given far too much screen time. Zendaya's Chani, I'm sorry but it was like the director was getting a bonus for every second she was on screen. Which might have been fine if the character was not portrayed in such a petulant and petty way. Her huff at the end of the film encapsulated this. Fine to make her role bigger, but it was done poorly.Chalamet's Paul did not develop convincingly, or at all. In the first film he played the character to a tee, but this time the writing left him the childish boy seemingly throughout. His ascendance to the Mahdi/Kwisatz Haderach via the water of life was not given anything like a vision (indeed throughout the film his/his mothers visions and the more mystical parts of the story were left out or completely underplayed). And left you at a loss why he was suddenly behaving so differently.Notable things were left out, in particular the Navigators, but also other elements you would assume would be in here.Too much long stares into the sand, I love the visuals and the whole mythos of this universe, but as a big fan I was sitting there bored several times.Their were some real highlights: Paul's first riding of the worm was really well done. The whole section on Geidi Prime was really great. The fight/battle scenes were done really well also.

{"id": 240, "title": "Woah", "content": "When you find yourself boarding the hype train, you run the risk of raising people's expectations too much. It's a reason I don't often like to give out perfect ratings straight away... but with Dune: Part Two, I can't think of any way it misstepped or let me down. This could be the best epic movie since The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King, or at least the most epic to successfully tell a story on this scale in a flawless way. For as good as 2021's Dune was, it just feels like a warm-up compared to Dune: Part Two, which is where things get bolder, more expansive, and much more morally complex. Dune is to Star Wars what Dune: Part Two is to The Empire Strikes Back; a basically perfect sequel to something that was already great, but is taken to new heights with a second installment.Dune: Part Two is also much better paced than the first movie, which has a lot of set-up to lay out early on, peaks at the end of its second act with a big battle sequence, and then has a slightly strange final act that now feels more like it functions as a prologue to Part Two. Dune: Part Two manages to kind of hit the ground running, but then wisely doesn't try to maintain a sprint all the way. It slows down where it needs to, and then continues to build to a final act that is mind-blowing in scale. I felt like I got goosebumps on my cheeks; I didn't even know you could get that feeling there. I also felt almost light-headed and overwhelmed, but in a good way. Seeing something on this scale pulled off this well comes just a handful of times a decade, if you're lucky.Timothee Chalamet is given much more to do, returning characters are taken to darker places that somehow feel both inevitable and surprising, the special effects are perfectly done, the new characters are great (Austin Butler comes amazingly close to overdoing it, but I feel like he's just the right level of unhinged), and the score/use of sound is incredible; as good or better than the first. Overall, it really does feel like an improvement across the board, wrapping up the first two movies well while giving some indication as to where things could go. It was a film that was worth the wait.

{"id": 242, "title": "It was Good, But It Was Long", "content": "Dune 2 ReviewThe following was my first reaction after watching this film...It was good, but it was long. I mean it was good, it was good. But it was long. Now I'm not saying I didn't like it, it was good ok? But it was long. Did it need to be that long? Well ok it was a really big story so yeah OK it probably needed to be that long. But it was long, man. But it was good. But it was long. I don't know what my final decision is because you know, it was good. But it was long...I caught someone sitting in front of me checking the time as the film slowly slogged on. Performances were solid all around. The story is well worn. The photography was, well, iconic. But it seemed a little too much on the extreme close ups of faces. My god, the lensing was so tight that in one shot the character's eyes were in focus but his nose was out of focus. On Imax, we can inspect every pore on his skin.Overall, there was something more exciting about part one, as we are introduced to the setup. Am intriguing world shot in a iconic way. Engaging characters in energetic scenes. I saw the first part twice in the theatre. I have the DVD at home and have watched it again since. I am not so excited about revisiting part two. I guess it's a kind of phenomena like the Matrix. The first film was very appealing because of it's well crafted fantasy world that was exciting to learn about. But by the second movie, it was already kind of been there, done that. I sort of had the same reaction with The Dark Knight Rises after enjoying the bombastic Dark Knight.Dune as a story is so popular, George Lucas used it as one of his sources for Star Wars. The chosen one template is very familiar, and it takes larger-than-life filmmaking to make it something that stands out. This comes in the form of the depiction of a desert world that has gargantuan flying machines. The domiciles in this world are simple but elegant. The costumes are evocative of ancient religions. The music fit as well as it did in part one.Appropriately, the second movie is simply titled Part Two. For it is more of the same. So the second outing there is less awe to some degree, and more drama, with shots of very very large heads. I'm not knocking this film in any way. I think perhaps my own short attention span is at fault. As an editor, I wouldn't dare question the wisdom of the people who put this together. It is a service to all fans of this classic story to tell it right. Perhaps if I was the director, I would pick up the pacing of the dialogue just a wee little bit. But I'm sure it wouldn't work as well.In conclusion, the movie has many good scenes of grandeur, but has more scenes of big faces. Sure, great care was taken to hire some of the most attractive faces available, so that helps. I guess I enjoy rollicking adventures more than slightly sedate adventures like this one. Maybe time will change my attitude about Part Two compared to Part One. But for now I will give it a 7 out of 10.", "rating": 7, "sentiment": 1, "date": "2 March 2024", "name": "kgprophet"}

Sitting in the theater, having only just finished my re-reading of Dune the day before, I realized that only about 20% of the movies material were scenes from the novel and even still scene were taken in a completely different context. The characters are simply not the same characters from the novel, but even more than that they are not the same as the first part and that is apparent from their inconsistent motivations. Overall, the movie is not bad. I give it 5 out of 10 because it is a generic, middle of the pack movie. Which is even more upsetting when paired with the knowledge that following the plot of the already established novel would have provided a much higher score.

{"id": 249, "title": "A Complex Vision", "content": "The book builds a very large and complicated world, even by science fiction standards. So to even dare to create a film version of it was ambitious from day one. There are so many ways it could go wrong, and so many risks. Part One worked (at least for me). I was apprehensive about Part Two, as I feared it might let me down, or become bogged down in the vast details of the novel, or be yet another victim of film-making by committee so that everything lost its colour and strangeness. That did not happen. This is a special film. It's an intelligent, beautifully made blockbuster. It's an act of devotion for the novels, too.Dune Part Two is a long, thought-provoking and ambitious film that sets out as a philosophical study of the nature of belief and religion, and manages to be that without losing any of the spectacular visual beauty and drama along the way. It isn't a particularly light or easy film, but it is stunning, and it asks you to pay attention to it fully. It's a serious film. I respect that, because it's a serious book with a serious point to make.The landscapes are striking and strange. There are thrilling and tense moments. There are also softer moments of intimacy and strong characterisation. I think Lady Jessica particularly comes across as extraordinarily dangerous, manipulative, and without any other options except to be that. Paul is the reluctant messiah who understands that nothing actually compels him to do what the prophecies say, but that at the same time, he will do what the prophecies say, because there is no other way out. His struggles are very well represented and easy to understand, without being over-simplified.What I did not like, the reason it's a 9 rather than a 10, was that a couple of moments were a little unnaturally segued into, in my opinion. Things seemed to be rather sudden developments on occasion. I also think the ending was good in that it wasn't an ending but just a beginning of a new phase of the story, which fits with the novels and Paul's situation, but it might have left some people rather unsatisfied.", "rating": 9, "sentiment": 1, "date": "11 March 2024", "name": "alisonkatebr"}

Sometimes you can just feel the reverance and dedication an artist has for the craft and faithfully adapting a classic story. What a time to be alive. Faith in cinema restored completely. Zendaya's Chani, though she doesn't impact the narrative much, frames the thematic structure better than in the book and has a forceful presence and voice that can't be silenced. Chalamet effortlessly maneuvers between the quiet, reserved child of privilege and the crazed messiah willing and able to destory anything in his path. Javier Bardem brings the deep reverance, teacher, philosopher, and comic relief elements seemlessly. I don't know where to stop with the cast, so I'll just leave it there.

{"id": 260, "title": "Good Continuation", "content": "(spoilers) Have been waiting awhile (over 2 years actually like everyone else) for director Villeneuve's continuation with Dune 2 and was not disappointed. 'Dune 2' is a formidable and at times spectacular cinema. I will say I liked its predecessor's pacing better than this one whose finale seemed a bit anti-climactic and off kilter. The stylized visuals give way to a cramped and dark-lit final set that seemed like a stage play oddly a bit out of place from some earlier beautiful, and intricate set designs.. Catching this on IMAX though was certainly worthwhile though. Javier Bardem fills in for the life and energy of the movie somewhat similar to Jason Momoa in the earlier film. Easily the best scene of the movie for me was the earlier fight scene with Harkonnen harvester, ground troops and Paul and Chani in serious battle , the fight choreography and melding of visual affects and sound was absoluately stunning and 1st rate putting even the Empire Strikes Back Hoth effects to shame. Was overall pleased with this entry and looking forward to Villeneuve's next picture, hopefully Science Fiction. Got the feelling more Dune will be on the way - looking forward to it.

{"id": 261, "title": "Who needs Games of Thrones", "content": "I have been a Dune fan from David Lynch's to the doc Jodowrosky. Now.part two is here n is way i expected as one to watch for this year.The movie stay true to the book n reinvented it it ways that director Denis Villeneuve is the master of neo sci fi. The story telling is well crafted for a three hour film how he balances from the guerrilla warfare on Arrakis to introducing new characters that will play a pivotal role.Like the relationship of Timothee Chalamet n Zedaya how they matter ones to the other, facing every trial along the way from battling the Hawkkonen to not going where the fundamental live south, n that's where everything goes down hill i love how Zedaya Chani rejects the idea of Paul drinking the water of life n change him into another person who interests in starting a war then spending hes life with her.Timothee shiny very awesomely in playing Paul trying to prove to the freeman to hes vision of the dangers have if he goes south, when he messiah mode thats the worst come out n is great from the secret thats he Hawkornen to not caring what Chani thinks of him now. Is absolutely brilliant in character development.Rebecca Ferguson as the new reverend mother was scary but well David Lynch type she spend the whole film talking to her unborn child n to me that was beautiful bizarre cause shows her dark side of the belief that the freeman has to Paul.Josh Brolin plays well as Josh Brolin, Stellan Skarsgard love every moment as Baron indulging himself went he how take command on Arrakis, but villainy acting proves that he can make control everything.Manipulated, cinical, omen forcefully oh yeah she was mean, Javier Bandem play a well freeman believer from been obsessive to the prophecy to showing Paul the ropes for sandworm surfing's. But the one that made good impression got to go to the socialpath of Feyf-Rautina from he's debut on the glatorial in the Hawkonnen home planet, to taking charge of the freeman attacks, ending it with knife due with Paul Mua Di, this villain that define today's sci fi madmen but more psichotic.My goodness the the sound track was extra comical, making sound of fate to the torment of war. But best when belief becomes fanaticism n soundtrack prove that's. N then ye got the cinematography by Greg Fraser love the wind blowing the dunes the mountains of the freeman, to the toxically world of the Hawkonnen to the emperor phere ship entering Arrakis, n the spice homebased. Villeneuve vision of this world was magnificent inspire by true events like the prophecy of freeman is something coming's from the Muslim belief, to also their attention to their own art of war, where fanaticism can take a whole group of believers.So to conclude is epic this is the version that we ve waiting for since Frank Herberg publish it, n it doesn't bored for the three hours that run, there's more to see from this world n the many houses that depend on spice production, it hasn't been confirm that Villeneuve will direct messiah, chances re is gonna happen.By then i better read it.", "rating": 10, "sentiment": 1, "date": "4 March 2024", "name": "phzgnkn"}

While it is a solid, entertaining sci fi movie, labeling it the GOAT or anything similar to that, is just people fanning out over it. Maybe it's just the time that we're living in now, where people are prisoners of the moment far too often but I remember a time when it took something way more groundbreaking than what this movie offers to call it the greatest sci fi movie of all time. There's really nothing \"special\" about it. Sure, the cinematography is strong and some of the action scenes are very entertaining but there's nothing crazy innovative about this film. It's a sort of paint by the numbers - messiah type tale. The chemistry between zendaya and chalamet is really good and Butler turns in a solid turn as the villain. But outside of that, there's nothing that's gonna etch this movie in the sands of time, imo. I remember when The Matrix came out and seeing that in theaters and being completely mind blown by it!!! I had never seen anything like that before. It may be unfair but that'll be a standard I'll hold any movie vying for \"best sci fi film of all time\" to until my last days as a film watcher. This is a solid movie but don't buy into the hype, temper your expectations and you'll enjoy it just fine.Definitely a film that is more enjoyable on a large screen with great surround sound. The director and his crew set up some really great looking shots that are best enjoyed on a large screen. With that said, the score and visual aesthetic is very one note and drab. Which, I get it, it's part of the mood and tone the director is going for. But for me it's very sterile and cold. Not an insane fun, hold on to the seat of your pants type film with a ROUSING score that gets you hyped for the action that's unfolding before you. Having seen Dune Part One recently, it's not that I necessarily expected that from this movie but when I heard the \"goat\" word being thrown around, it did raise my expectations of what we'd see on the screen.Again, a fine film but nothing genre defining imo. One of those that you can watch once and you'll be fine with lol.Unlike the best of this genre where you can't wait to rewatch it over and over and over again...! Where the action is unlike anything you've ever seen, the characters are rich and layered, and likable figures. The score is fun and captivating even if it's a dark one. You go and tell everyone that they need to watch this movie ASAP.

The VFX is brilliant, the art style seems to be leaning in between Geiger style for all Harkonen Architecture and Doug Chiang for all the vehicles ... Costumes, VFX, environments there is nothing to complain about there... The script for Paul and Chani is written well, you can feel the chemistry between characters as well, Rebecca Ferguson does well playing lady Jessica, her storyline was intresting to follow... There is one point however where Villeneuve Dune could do better than it did and it's lord Vladimir Harkonen, now don't get me wrong, the acting of Stellan is brilliant, but his script lacks clever plotting and scheming, his script is very straight pure evil, I don't doubt he should be evil, but instead of melancholic evil they could do a sociopathic evil which plots and schemes and comes up with clever ideas to do evil, instead it felt like lord Harkonen is so done with everyone...

{"id": 275, "title": "I want to like \"Dune: Part Two\" more than I actually do", "content": "Back in 2021, at the height of the coronavirus pandemic, HBO Max (now known as simply Max) released Denis Villeneuve's adaption of \"Dune\" the same day that it was released theatrically. So, I decided to sit down on my couch and give it a watch. Perhaps influenced by the horrendous streaming experience - with constant freezes, bufferings, and drops in quality - I didn't much enjoy \"Dune.\" Cut to March 1, 2024. I planned on seeing \"Dune: Part Two\" in theatres. Before doing so, in order to refresh my (alcohol-influenced and shockingly poor) recollection, I decided to watch 2021's \"Dune\" again, this time on 4k Blu-Ray. And even though the viewing experience was far better than the one I had watching it many years ago on HBO Max, to my surprise, my opinion remained the same - \"Dune,\" to me, was a visually stunning but emotionally hollow and surprisingly cold feeling film. Its lack of characterization and flimsy script didn't allow me to invest in the characters as much as I found myself investing in the world building. However, with \"Dune: Part Two\" on the horizon, I suspended my judgement until I was able to see the complete story that Villeneuve wanted to tell. Now, after watching this second installment, unfortunately, my opinion hasn't wavered.Denis Villeneuve always crafts a stunning looking and sounding film, and \"Dune: Part Two\" is no different. Its use of CGI is second to none, with effects so good looking that you'll find yourself forgetting they aren't real. The sense of scale is immense, with vistas, settings, and scenery that will make your breath catch in your throat at the sight of them. Also, a specific black and white sequence is especially striking, and almost had me wishing for a second edit of the film that completely loses all colour. To be sure, \"Dune: Part Two\" is a visual and auditory fest; and if you're going for that, and only that, you'll have a lot to love here. Where the film falters, however, is in its lack of characterization.For as gorgeous of a movie as this is, I wish that the script writing and character development was as strong as the visuals. Similar to the issue I had with the first film, \"Part Two\" continues with characters that are, frankly, flat and dry; this seems to be a trend in Villeneuve's films, so I imagine that these performances were requested by the director. And, in some way, I do understand where he may have been coming from - the world of \"Dune\" is alien, and might call for appropriately alien performances. So, I get it, but I don't like it. The actors do seem to be making the most out of what the script gives them, with Rebecca Ferguson and Javier Bardem giving standout performances - Javier especially looks like he's having a lot of fun. Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet, an actor that I admire, remains serviceable as Paul Atreides, but undergoes significant tonal shifts in his performance that I found not as believable as I think the filmmakers wanted these shifts to come across.The characters of the film do deal with some themes I found extremely interesting, themes of religious prophecies, faith, doubt, control and the measures people will take to attain it, and more. In that regard, I enjoyed watching how the characters that inhabit this movie all have differing opinions on the above - some think Paul truly is the one, while others regarding the prophecies as nothing more than tales meant to oppress the masses. It's really quite bold for a mainstream movie to deal with these types of topics; and while I wish Villeneuve pushed things just a bit further, I recognize that a potential third film may be going in the direction that I am hoping for.\"Dune: Part Two\" is an achievement, and begs to be seen on the biggest screen possible (or the closest seat possible, if you find yourself watching it not in Imax, but on an ordinary theatre screen, like I did). In terms of visual storytelling, the movie shines, and I imagine many high scores are being influenced by the film's razzle and dazzle. In terms of character development and strong scriptwriting, the movie faltered for me, not offering that emotional anchor necessary to invest me in the characters as much as I was invested in the world. All of that said, the world building at play truly is astounding, and I am hoping for a third installment if nothing else than to immerse myself in the universe that Villeneuve has put to film.", "rating": 5, "sentiment": 1, "date": "3 March 2024", "name": "darkreignn"}

Sadly it did not live up to my expectations. It was still good enough, and certainly better then the first one, but it certainly had its flaws. Let's start off with the good. It had a packed cast, I knew probably about 90% of them, and they all acted well. It had amazing cinematography, e.g the orange atmosphere at the start, and all the close ups of the characters, mostly Paul always staring at something in a scared, hopeful, or sigma way. Another amazing feature of the cinematography was the moments of the music going quiet so you could focus on things like the rumble of a worm, or the thumping of the the worm caller, or Paul's deep breathing. This certainly was a fun theatre experience. This move also stepped up the humour a bit more, with characters like Josh Brolin and Javier Bardem having more screen time. It's such a shame that Jason Momoa's character was dead because he could've been the third funny character. Now let's talk about the flaws. The movie was still really boring and slow going, but no where near as bad as the first one. And it seemed to follow a plot line like Star Wars. Where all of the main characters are related, just the same as most of the heroes in Star Wars are all Skywalkers! And Dave Bautista's character was so annoying, and he got killed off in the end alongside his two relatives. One of which was just introduced and he was a great villain, but he got killed off, and he didn't even get enough screen time. So certain aspects of the movie were fun to see in theatre, but I reckon you should wait to see this movie on streaming services.", "rating": 8, "sentiment": 1, "date": "9 March 2024", "name": "jaspercobar"}

{"id": 280, "title": "Unparalleled Epic Visual Extravaganza", "content": "Dune Part 2 is a breathtaking visual extravaganza that not only provides the next chapter in the Dune Universe but also takes you on a spiritual journey. The film begins where the last film left off,We see Paul and his Mother Lady Jessica integrate within the culture of Fremen and just like the first film the culture and customs of the Fremen are explained seamlessly. They have their own language,their religion and prophecies,the way they value and preserve water is also explained. The cast just like the last film is phenomenal and everyone just crushes it on the screen. Timothee Chalamet and Rebecca Ferguson once again carry the emotional heft of the story perfectly as Paul Atreides accepts his place as the Messiah while Lady Jessica becomes a spiritual leader to the Fremen because of her Bene Gesserit past. Javier Bardem and Zendaya get to shine as Stilgar and Chani respectively. Stilgar's belief in the prophecy and it's implications is conveyed exceptionally by Mr Bardem while Zendaya does a great job as Chani a brave fremen soldier who loves Paul but is constantly at loggerheads with the prophecy. Austin Butler as Feud Ratha stands out immensely. He is ferocious, blood thirsty and a psychotic maniac. Florence Pugh as Princess Irulan is contemplative and devoted to her father but does not have much to do in the story. The cinematography in this movie by Greg Frasier exceeds expectations and it should definitely be watched on the biggest screen possible. This film also has a lot more action than the first film and the action scenes are visceral and very entertaining to watch on the big screen. This film overall is a satisfying conclusion to the story setup in the first installment even though this film definitely sets up future installments. The score by Hans Zimmer is epic which might be an understatement but the score arouses you when Paul ascends and take his place as the Lisan-Al Ghaib. The score during the action scenes will also pump you up. Director Denis Villenueue understands that despite the epic scope of this film it still is Paul's journey and he takes it to fruition here.

This is one of the best movies I have ever watched. It's definetly in my top 15. Maybe top 10 or higher movies of all time. So let's break down whyMusic: Hans Zimmer. Greatest of all time. The music that is portrayed through the film is just perfection. It's fantastic. It's tasty. It's impressive and it's filled with emotions. Every scene tells a tale and a story but with the music it becomes dreamy. Absolutely fantastic to see and feel and hear.Writing: This movie actually follows the books. I haven't personally read the books but many of my close friends has and they all say they are very pleased. From a neutral point of view, the lines, the way the movie and character was shown was fantastic. How certain words and lines, like Javier Bardem put out can fill your head with a much larger picture, is exactly what this movie needs. So well \"world building\". I am just deeply impressed. It wasn't too much comedy or jokes, but the perfect amount that got everyone in the cinema laughing, to people in the cinema crying and being impressed by the scenery.Visuals: Breathtaking. Fantastic. I don't have enough words. Some of the CGI (like 2 or 3 small parts) I found a bit odd but that's just movies for you. The visuals were fantastic. Denis is right. Some scenes you don't need words or lines to portray emotion or set the scene. Music and certain visuals will do it for you. Scary, Epic, Insane, Love. Everything was perfect. I am deeply impressed. Only movie recently with better visuals was Avatar 2 and that says A LOT!!!Characters: I don't want to make this way to long but wow. Timothy killed it. Javier killed it. Austin killed it. Zendaya killed it. Every actor killed it. Stellan was just PERFECT AGAIN!!! Scary as a ...... just fantastic man. So well done. Acting was perfect. Switching between emotions. I have just no words.

All viallians feel quite weak, bland, and never seem to pose any real threat. Bautista's character is a joke, Baron isn't threatening, and the new villian (being called as good as joker by some people) also feels very generic. The *new abilities* that Paul gets also feel too convenient and easy to get.2. Characters change a lot instantly, Jessica suddenly becomes this completely different character, and same goes with Paul.3. I can see how it may have to be rushed in the movie format, but the pacing could've been better.4. Paul is the prophesied prophet, and... That just happens with no surprises etc. In some ways, I think that was for the better, as it avoids the overdone struggling hero cliche, but I was prepared to feel tense for Paul, but never really felt that there was a reason to feel tense.Overall, it's a solid 8/10, it is a technical masterpiece if you look at cinematography etc., but as a movie overall, it's just another 'good watch' which is well worth its time, and that's completely fine.", "rating": 8, "sentiment": 1, "date": "4 March 2024", "name": "maximumsid"}

{"id": 289, "title": "An Excellent Sci-Fi Epic", "content": "Dune: Part Two doesn't drop the ball when it comes to the narrative, visual and audio masterpiece that it is. Having seen it in IMAX quality, definitely an experience and one that I will look forward to seeing again outside of the Cinema.Butler's role as Feyd was impressive despite the limited screen time that he had, although it's hard to say he amounted to much in the film but this is how the book narrative goes so it isn't surprising.I've seen the original David Lynch's Dune, which is still decent for what it is, but the modern takes are far superior in almost everyway.One thing that I enjoy about these films is the audio impact. Denis Villeneuve cannot be criticized for the sound design on these films; they feel iconic, impactful and futuristic, particularly certain scenes that have the mongolian-like throat singing being uttered as a different language.Visually, just like Villeneuve's Blade Runner, it's beautifully shot and there are some amazing visuals of the Dune stretched sand plains. Despite it being a desert, you still get the sense that this is an alien planet.I did personally feel the ending was almost rushing towards its conclusion and the big battle that takes place towards the end was let down in scope and design somewhat. It was one of the very few areas that I thought the David Lynch film did better, if only slightly. It didn't sour the experience though.Denis Villeneuve has made a setup for part 3 and that is most certainly gonna happen.One disappointing post-movie element that concerns more about Villeneuve than the film itself is his obsession with refusing to release deleted scenes. Normally these things get brushed under the carpet and rarely discussed, but so much talk about this has popped up in the media recently and the reason is because the actors in these scenes have spoken out concerning these scenes.Villeneuve seems almost obsessed with the notion that his theatrical vision is finale and the fat that he trims from the film are discarded. This is understandable and you can't fault him for it, but it is disappointing that this is his stance.You could look at Blade Runner's disappointing theatrical cut vs the directors final cut and you can see the difference; the directors cut is the superior with deleted scenes added in and the narrative greatly improved.What if we never saw Saruman's downfall in LOTR: Return of the King if Peter Jackson decided that infamous scene should remain cut?We have the same problem in Part 2 with a certain character who was in Part 1 conspicuously absent. One could make the argument that Villeneuve's vision is somewhat hampered by him fighting the runtime limits enforced upon him by having him cut important scenes that sometimes add the missing context.Regardless of that, Dune Part 2 can't be missed; Part 3 is going to have a very tough time to follow up considering it's story is profoundly different from the previous two iterations.", "rating": 9, "sentiment": 1, "date": "10 March 2024", "name": "dplowsav"}

The characters, the actors, their masterful delivery, the settings, the dialogue, the writing, the storyline, the production, effects and photography, the direction; all these things vibrate with a heavy, redolent air of urgency, crisis and gravitas. There is an immense emotive weight behind this movie's production. The primary actors in this tale are powerful and astonishingly well portrayed. The heavy religious backstory which empowers this movie is unvoiced but dominant never the less. Violence, and there is no shortage of that, prevails, but seemingly it is more a response to genocidal repression than a specific ethnic pogrom, or politic strategy.Even so, the response of the Freman to their attackers, is grounded, inherent and succinctly Neolithic in the timbre of its violence. Hand to hand interchanges with sacred blades, the teeth of the massive sand worms, leaves most foes with some serious linkage. Eventually, though, politics does win out. Where the third installment of this series will go, a la the original books' storyline, is difficult to conceive. This is not because it is not written, rather it's because it becomes harder to understand and relate to. At the end of the movie, the humble, self-effacing Paul Atreides seems left behind in the in escapably blind willingness to surrender to his own predestined fate as Emperor.

In part 2 there was obviously a great deal more development and yet there were several pockets of the movie that just felt like a waste of time. When things were happening they felt rushed and undersold and when they weren't they just dragged on.For example - Paul's pre born sister Alia felt wildly underwhelming. And she's one of the biggest reveals of the books. I also felt like Villeneuve left maybe a bit too much on the cutting room table. Part 2 felt oddly g-rated. The violence was largely bloodless like a marvel movie and intimate scenes were shot from the shoulders up.Dune is far more adult than that. Personally that's what I've been \"thirsting\" for. A movie like this made for adults.Performances were by and large well done.Chalamet turns in his usual subdued but strong performance.Zendaya seems a little out of place this time around now that she actually had a role rather than only being in visions. She mostly reminded me of an angry 12 year old boy.Javier Bardem and his fanatical Stilgar were great and once he becomes a believer you can see Bardem really start to have fun.Rebecca Ferguson is still by far the strongest actor in this series. Every shot she's in - you just don't blink. She's absolutely mesmerizing.Josh Brolin does his Josh Brolin thing. Serves his purpose.Austin Butler, you can tell puts alot of work into his roles. He does well here.Florence Pugh is more like furniture to me. Like everything I've seen her in I know she's there but I'm not really paying attention to her. In Oppenheimer I realized I was ignoring her when she was on screen and I wasn't even doing it on purpose.Which leads me to my problems with this cut of the film - Pugh and Christopher Walken just felt empty.There wasn't enough time spent trying to understand them. Less b-roll of the desert and maybe more focus on character development would have been good.Why would the emperor kill Paul's father who was like a son to him? I know they explained it but it didn't feel... enough. I didn't know or care enough about the character or his motivations to feel genuine. Even if his reasons were manufactured by a certain group and exacerbated by his own pettiness, fear, and jealousy. This is a movie. This is Show not Tell.With all of that being said - Dune Part 2 is by far the best thing to come out of Hollywood in years which is why people are freaking out like it's the 2nd coming.

{"id": 297, "title": "Cultural, Important, Intense", "content": "When the screen turned black, I felt an intense sadness that this Is it. This is the greatest. This is the limit of what cinema can achieve.You can't talk about Dune without talking about religion. It somehow manages it to critique monotheistic religious concepts like Christianity and Islam, without ever feeling pretentious. It offers room to rethink the whole idea of religion. Every characters offers different perspective, and how someone perceives what exactly the film wants to say is up to them, but no matter what, I've never seen a film with such strong substance.For me, Dune is a demonstration that faith Is control, you can only guide a mass with belief, worshipping someone will always have horrific effects on society. Individuality is lost in the process of worshipping and existing-for-a-higher-reason.There is so much cultural influence from Christianity and Islam in Dune, and that makes it's story more realistic and interesting. It makes it clear that it's speaking towards these religious ideas, this is what makes Dune feel like less of an work of fiction, but more of an analysis and take on monotheistic religions intertwined with climate change in an science-fiction setting.Dune 2 It's filmmaking style Is literally the final stage of IMMERSIVE and INTENSE. I want to thank all the VFX- and sound design artists personally for making it feel like I'm living through this with the characters on arrakis. Words literally cannot explain what Dune 2 feels like. Jessica drinking the water of life, The whole first worm ride scene, the arena scene, the final knife fight... These are the scenes that got me the most goosebumps. But to be honest, the whole picture is made with so much care and love that makes it hard to choose a favorite.Denis Villeneuve just understands how to direct and motivate a crew properly. He made everyone do their job just so damn good, there is no single aspect that comes short, I missed these kind of films with so much care and love and vision, that it feels fresh again.But Dune 2, isn't just some film from that category. It deals with highly critical and ever-lasting topics, that'll always be important until the end of our very existence. It doesn't matter whether you're religious or not, everyone should see this film to see belief and worshipping from a different perspective. I love Dune 2, this is how films should hold mirrors up to society.", "rating": 10, "sentiment": 1, "date": "3 March 2024", "name": "hanschsolo"}

The sheer scale of this masterpiece is mindblowing. How can you go back to watching a normal movie after this?

He was frightening on screen. I was ready to bow and call him my king. And Zendaya delivers a masterclass in acting. She is the heart of the movie and her performance moved me. Butler is also phenomenal, but the problem is that he did not get a lot of screen time. When he's there, he is amazing, but he is barely in the film! It was, honestly, disappointing to have such a great villain and performance not be in the movie longer. It was anticlimactic.The whole movie builds up to the final showdown between the houses. It's cool, I guess, but it does not have any real kick. There does not seem to be any stakes. The big action sequences were not as great as the first one. It works, but it's nothing special. The story is the most interesting with Paul's (Chalamet) journey and transformation. Also, the more intimate action sequences, only featuring a handful of characters, are incredible (for example: the harvester scenes and the knife fight).With that being said, this might be the greatest film ever.

{"id": 300, "title": "A big come down in quality compared to Part 1", "content": "\"Dune: Part 2\" had the weight of expectation upon its shoulders, following the success of its predecessor. However, this highly anticipated sequel falls short of achieving the same level of excellence. Directed by Denis Villeneuve, the film struggles with uneven pacing, lackluster character development, and a narrative that feels rushed and heavy-handed.One of the glaring issues with \"Dune: Part 2\" is its pacing, which oscillates between dragging in the middle third and rushing through the final third. The film spends too much time on inconsequential events, leaving little room for character arcs to develop organically. Paul's transformation from a reluctant leader to a megalomaniac zealot feels particularly rushed and lacking in depth, robbing the audience of the opportunity to truly empathize with his journey. Having attended a late evening showing there were times I was actually checking my watch, unbelievably so, but I have to admit myself bored particularly past the first hour mark.Rather than feeling a drama play out in real time, we're simply told drama 'is' playing out. Its a subtle but important difference, but one which needs to be acknowledged. Unfortunately there is no sense of stakes here, instead its just characters accomplishing one task after the other until Paul can eventually become 'The Messiah'. At no point did I ever feel this was under threat, yet apparently according to what the characters are saying, that's EXACTLY how I should be feeling.Another one of my main complaints was the love story between Paul and Chani, with it feeling forced and clich\u00e9d to the nth degree. The lack of chemistry between the two actors was distracting and the on-again, off-again nature of their romance detracted from the emotional weight their relationship is apparently supposed to carry. It's a narrative thread that we've seen countless times before, yet done better in other movies, leaving viewers feeling indifferent rather than invested; I had no real reason to care about these two, other than I was told I was supposed to by the plot. We can call Dune Part 2 a masterpiece all we want, but when the main romance and arguably main backdrop of the second installment feels corny, then we know we've got problems.The introduction of Austin Butler's Feyd-Rautha character also feels unnecessary and cartoonish. His role usurps that of Dave Bautista's Beast Rabban from the world-building of the first film, only to be disposed of by the end of the sequel. This decision undermines the tension that could and probably SHOULD have been built with Bautista's character and leaves audiences questioning the purpose of Butler's inclusion. Feyd Rautha felt 'evil for the sake of evil' and a mere device to give the hero's of Paul and Chani something to aim at, whilst not actually threatening to alter the plot.Despite these shortcomings, \"Dune: Part 2\" does have its strengths, particularly in its visual effects, framing, and atmosphere. Denis Villeneuve once again proves himself a master of his craft, creating stunning visuals that transport audiences to the world of Arrakis. However, these moments of visual brilliance can sometimes feel overindulgent, with scenes of desert landscapes and thumpers dragging on for longer than necessary. Credit where credit is due however....Ultimately, \"Dune: Part 2\" fails to deliver a satisfying payoff, with the Emperor's defeat feeling anticlimactic and Christopher Walken's portrayal lacking the gravitas it deserves. While the film runs for a lengthy time, almost none of it is given towards developing his character and giving the audience a reason to care about his potential affect and inclusion in the narrative. Unfortunately he just exists here as a confused looking old man, and the film is poorer for it.In conclusion, \"Dune: Part 2\" is a visually impressive but a narratively underwhelming sequel. While it may have been hailed as a masterpiece by some, it ultimately fails to live up to its potential. Those seeking to immerse themselves in the world of \"Dune\" would be better off sticking to the books, as the film leaves much to be desired, particularly given its lengthy runtime. As a non book reader myself, I sure know where I'll be heading now to get my Dune fix.", "rating": 6, "sentiment": 1, "date": "13 March 2024", "name": "liamnoble1"}
{"id": 301, "title": "Science-fiction EPIC at its best, grand entertainment", "content": "Denis Villeneuve delivers nothing short of a monumental achievement in science-fiction filmmaking, and the best adaption of Frank Herbert's Dune up to date. The world is captivating, the visual effects and the production design are flawless. Greig Fraser's breath taking Cinematography, accompanied by Zimmer's sumptuous musical score bring you into the story of the madness of conquest and the power of belief.Filled with breathtaking images, stunning action, it's a story that transcends it's genre. A story that is dense as the world of Dune remains intriguingly complex, full of characters whose roles shift and evolve. And even if it may take five and a half hours for his character to truly come to life, two films in, Chalamet's evolution as Paul gives everything a center. His subdued yet compelling performance serves the thematic ambiguity of Paul's character well. Zendaya gets more screen time then in the first film, but for me the standout performance came from Rebecca Ferguson. During this film I truly understood why she was best cast for this role. Javier Bardem further enriches the ensemble cast.The best new addition to the crew is Austin Butler as the baron's bald-pated, hyper vicious nephew. As for Florence Pugh, even if her character is only getting a certain amount of screen time amidst Dune: Part Two's cast of returning characters, her impact could not be seen as minimal, setting the scene for further character development. Other newer characters like Lady Margot remain a bit more unexplored.In our age of ever-increasing runtimes, it's a rare achievement that the film's 166-minute length feels really earned. But I do wish it had even more EVEN MORE run time, to allow more time for the most uncomfortable emotions to linger on in some scenes.Ultimately, Dune: Part Two is a grand entertainment that also sustains the main ideas of Frank Herbert's novel, exploring the dark aspects around religion, politics, power and violence. Absolute sensory overload. This must be seen on the biggest screen possible, with IMAX being almost like a chief's kiss. If Dune: Part 1 didn't make you a believer; Part 2 just might.Cannot wait for Dune Messiah for us to have the complete trilogy, in the vison of the masterful director Denis Villeneuve.", "rating": 10, "sentiment": 1, "date": "2 March 2024", "name": "Joanna_jo"}

The film's visuals, once again, are nothing short of breathtaking, with sweeping desert vistas and intricately designed spacecraft that transport viewers to the heart of this expansive world.Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet's portrayal of Paul Atreides continues to impress, as he navigates the treacherous waters of power and destiny with a maturity beyond his years. His chemistry with Rebecca Ferguson, who shines once again as the fierce and enigmatic Lady Jessica, adds depth to their complex mother-son relationship.Newcomers to the cast, including Zendaya as the mysterious Fremen warrior Chani, and Javier Bardem as the charismatic Stilgar, breathe life into their respective roles, bringing a fresh energy to the ensemble.One of the film's greatest strengths lies in its ability to balance grand spectacle with intimate character moments. While the epic scale of the story is undeniably awe-inspiring, it is the human drama at its core that truly resonates. Themes of identity, loyalty, and sacrifice are explored with nuance and depth, inviting audiences to ponder the complexities of power and the nature of destiny.Hans Zimmer's haunting score once again elevates the film, perfectly complementing the grandeur and emotion of the narrative. His use of leitmotifs and sonic textures adds layers of meaning to each scene, immersing viewers in the world of Dune in ways both subtle and profound.The second installment of Denis Villeneuve's \"Dune\" saga not only builds upon the foundation laid by its predecessor but also delves deeper into the intricate politics and ideologies that shape the universe of Arrakis. As the power struggles between the noble houses intensify and the specter of war looms ever larger, the film navigates the murky waters of ambition and betrayal with deft precision.One of the film's most striking aspects is its attention to detail, both in its world-building and character development. From the intricacies of Fremen culture to the Machiavellian machinations of the various factions vying for control of Arrakis, every aspect of Herbert's universe is brought to vivid life on the screen. Each character, no matter how minor, feels fully realized, with their own motivations and desires driving the narrative forward.The cinematography, once again, deserves special mention for its ability to capture the otherworldly beauty of Arrakis while also conveying the harsh realities of life on the desert planet. From the towering sand dunes to the windswept sietches of the Fremen, every frame is a visual feast for the eyes, immersing viewers in a world that is at once alien and familiar.At the heart of the film lies the character of Paul Atreides, whose journey from reluctant heir to messianic figure is at once epic and deeply personal. Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet's portrayal is nothing short of mesmerizing, capturing the internal struggle and external pressures that define Paul's transformation with remarkable nuance and subtlety.The supporting cast, too, deserves praise for their performances, with each actor bringing their own unique talents to their respective roles. From Oscar Isaac's stoic portrayal of Duke Leto Atreides to Jason Momoa's charismatic turn as Duncan Idaho, every member of the ensemble contributes to the film's success, adding layers of complexity to an already rich tapestry of characters.Of course, no discussion of \"Dune Part 2\" would be complete without mentioning the film's thematic depth. At its core, \"Dune\" is a story about power - who wields it, who seeks it, and who ultimately pays the price for its pursuit. Through its exploration of themes such as colonialism, environmentalism, and the nature of prophecy, the film invites audiences to reflect on the timeless questions of ethics and morality that lie at the heart of human existence.In conclusion, \"Dune Part 2\" is a triumph of both storytelling and spectacle, a rare cinematic experience that manages to be both epic in scope and intimate in its emotional resonance. With its stunning visuals, compelling performances, and thought-provoking themes, it stands as a testament to the power of cinema to transport us to worlds beyond our imagination, while also challenging us to confront the truths that lie at the heart of our own humanity.", "rating": 10, "sentiment": 1, "date": "3 March 2024", "name": "pfzvspsgb"}
{"id": 307, "title": "Dune 2 - A science fiction master piece", "content": "Dune: Part One was my favourite movie of 2021. Originally slated to be released in November of last year, this second instalment was delayed due to the SAG-AFTRA strike. So it was with bated breath that I saw it last night in IMAX.Dune 2 is a masterpiece.It has been a very long time since a movie has left me speechless.It is Denis Villeneuve's magnum opus. Very much like how Christopher Nolan crowned his career with Oppenheimer last year, this is Villeneuve's greatest ever movie.Similar to Peter Jackson's, The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (2003), Dune 2 represents another evolution of cinema as an art form. I don't use that word lightly.This is the true definition of a vice movie (see 4 Types of Movies tab at the top of homepage). The story locks you in from the opening frame and at just 15 minutes shy of 3 hours, this movie absolutely flies by, not once during it's runtime was I bored.The only downside is my cinema going adventure's of 2024 has peaked with Dune: Part Two, nothing will compare to this movie for the rest of the year.Let's have a Catch up...The story picks up literally in the same frame as part one ended. Dune: Part One and Dune: Part Two have to be seen as one movie split into two, this is not a sequel. If part one was the starter, this is the main course. It makes the first movie better.Paul Atreides (Chalamet) cements his position on Arrakis. He along with his mother Jessica (Ferguson) who herself becomes the Revered Mother start to foresee a prophecy that Paul or to give him is Fremen name Usul will become the saviour of the planet. To reflect this Paul gives himself the name of Muad'Dib, a powerful name on Arrakis.Meanwhile, after Baron Harkonnen continues to lose his grip on Arrakis thanks to the losses at the hands of those \"Rats\" the Freman and the incompetence of his unstable nephew Beast Rabben (Batista), the Baron calls his beloved other nephew Feyd-Rautha (Butler) up to the plate to re-take the planet in his families name and setting the scene for war.So, the best way to review this movie because of it's immensity is to break it down, here goes..CinematographyEvery aspect of how this movie looks is frankly staggering. DP Greig Fraser not only makes each frame look like a stunning photograph, his use of camera angles, lighting and the natural environment is amazing. The battle scenes are jaw dropping and the sense of scale, especially the sand worms in IMAX is eye watering. I had spine tingles for most of the movie.Sound and ScoreThe sound is incredible, as I saw it in IMAX (which I implore you to do if able) leaves you shaken in your seat. You will never forget where and when you first saw and heard those sand worms. The score by the legendary composer Hans Zimmer is equally superb and is used to amazing effect.CastAs for the cast, each member of the star studied line-up absolutely bring their A game to the table. This movie makes Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet a man. Gone is the petulant son of Duke Leto Atreides (Oscar Isaac). I think Chalamet is fast becoming this generation's DiCaprio. Zendaya was equally superb as his partner Chiani, as she continues to show that she is one of the leading actresses of her geneartion.After his breakout role in Elvis (2022) and Apple TV+ series Masters of the Air (2024) Austin Butler is a revelation as the psychopathic Feyd-Rautha, beloved nephew to Baron Harkonnen.No Country for Old Men alum Josh Brolin and Javier Bardem resume their respective roles as Gurney Halleck and Stilgar offering gravitas and wise council to the younger cast who take centre stage.Florence Pugh as the emperors daughter Princess Irulan is excellent as is the great veteran actor Christopher Walken (In a small but pivotal role) as the Emperor.My only \"complaint\" as such is that Dave Batista's character Beast Rabben felt under served and was reduced to a bit of a one note character screaming out orders whilst slipping further out of the good graces of his uncle. On that subject, Baron Harkonnen (Skarsgard) himself so central to the original film is also somewhat side lined in this second part of the movie.ActionWhilst I in no way shared this sentiment, there were some people who said Dune: Part One was boring and lacked action. The same cannot be said for this continuing instalment.The action in this movie is breathtakingly shot and choreographed. Whether it was wide scale battles or hand to hand combat it felt exhilarating, organic and primal.Special EffectsA seamless blend of top drawer CGI and jaw dropping practical effects. Effortlessly combined with filming on location in Abu Dhabi.Impact on CinemaDune: Part One and Dune: Part Two, is this generations Star Wars. It however goes further than that, it is Star Wars for grown-ups. There is nothing Disney has done with Star Wars to rival or even come close to Villeneuve's incredible movie. It makes the recent MCU and DC movies look what they are, light weight tensionless candy floss poop.What Villeneuve has achieved here is simply staggering.It reminds you of why the medium of cinema exists.It is a science fiction masterpiece.Denis Villeneuve and team deserve all the adulation, box office success and awards they can get.Verdict - Unmissable.", "rating": 10, "sentiment": 1, "date": "2 March 2024", "name": "daddygamer5"}
{"id": 308, "title": "Spectacular Film and Adaptation", "content": "Firstly, I haven't read the books, but have a good understanding of the story and themes, and the weight on Villeneuve's shoulders for what he was adapting. And to say he pulled it off would be an understatement as he possibly created the perfect sequel to Dune Part One, a perfect adaptation combining the two books and all in all a near-perfect film on its own.Performances across the board are fantastic. Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet, Javier Bardem, Rebecca Ferguson and Austin Butler are the highlights. Butler's introduction has to be one of the most incredible villain introductions in all of cinema with Zimmer's extraordinary soundtrack (guaranteed another Oscar) and the intelligent camera infrared lens in the Harkonnen Arena. Chalamet is tremendous with a more complex, intense and nuanced in this film (take the Speech scene in South Arrakis), compared to the first when he was more stilted. Skarskg\u00e5rd delivers another intimidating and menacing performance as the Baron and small appearances from Seydoux and Pugh are worthy additions to the cast (with Pugh undoubtedly going to play a major role in Dune Part Three)Action sequences and visuals are of course stellar and usurp the first in quality. Standout has to be the Harkonnen Arena and the ending invasion of Arrakeen and the massacre of the Sardaukar with the Sandworms. Paul riding the Sandworm is an incredible sequence, no doubt elevated by Zimmer's score. Action choreography is also fantastic (especially in the final duel between Feyd-Rautha and Paul) rivalling that of John Wick.Villeneuve and Spaiths' writing is fantastic keeping with the quality of the first, developing the religious lore of Arrakis' North and South, the politics of the Imperium and the machiavellian scheming of the Bene Gesserit. All very captivating which I hope is further expanded in Dune Part Three. Paul also slowly shifting eventually revealing himself to be an Anti-hero was amazing to watch. Pacing isn't an issue and was glued from start to end.Criticisms: Two major gripes in that the final battle isn't really a battle and more a slaughter. Sardaukar and Harkonnen forces are completely defeated with Paul and the Fremen receiving little resistance to their onslaught. An excuse can be made as Paul is now the Kwisatz Haderach so an essentially invulnerable force, but it doesn't make for a jaw dropping climax. The battle is very much skipped over which is something I would've liked to have seen more of. Finally, I believe Feyd-Rautha left too quick. He was set up as a major antagonist for Paul as potentially his rival as the Kwisatz Haderach, but dies at the end and I don't think he's coming back. The other Harkonnen deaths were earned because they were in the first film and we saw their direct actions against Paul and his House; Feyd-Rautha as far as we knew had little involvement in the plot against House Atreides. Feyd-Rautha's death was well-written into the story with him duelling Paul, only wish perhaps he had more screen time or a more direct rivalry with Paul throughout the film than just the final duel.However, these criticisms aren't enough to bring the film down in any way.

{"id": 309, "title": "Temper your expectations...", "content": "Hear me out: I love sci-fi, and Denis Villeneuve is very skilled at creating Dune Pt. 1, Blade Runner 2049, and Arrival. Now we have Dune Pt. 2, which I just saw in IMAX at an early screening last night. It is, as you might expect, a technical marvel with a stacked cast who all bring their A-game. Like The Two Towers or Empire Strikes Back, it expands on the lore, worldbuilding, develops the main characters and introduces new ones. Most of what was set up on the story and character front is paid off to some degree here. The battle sequences are incredible and creative in places. I think it's safe to say that if you liked the first movie, you'll like this one. BUT, it's easier to admire than to love, with the characters at arms' length, even by the time the credits rolled. Keep in mind that while the movie is very good, it still has pacing issues and is too long. In fact, there is so much going on here that it feels like two movies' worth. This is not as great as the hype makes you believe (masterpiece, next LOTR, etc.). But as a sequel to Dune, it works well enough to entertain while suffering from that middle-chapter syndrome that most second chapters do.\n                \n                    9 out of 19 found this helpful.\n                        \n                            Was this review helpful?

I was very happy to see a lot of people in the theater at 10:30 am on a Saturday. Being surrounded by fellow science fiction fans was something I had missed.This movie was amazing. First I want to celebrate the fact that Lisa Gerrard did some of the vocals in one of the greatest movie scores I've ever experienced. I think the last movie she worked on was Gladiator nearly 25 years ago, and her voice is still perfection.For a film based in the desert, the cinematography still managed to capture the multifaceted landscapes over sand dunes, caves, cities and the genius work with those giant worms.The plot continues immediately where part one left off, and it hardly spent a moment recapping. If you haven't seen part one, then that's on you. While watching the movie there were parts I was expecting to pick at when I wrote this review, but they all were answered before the close of the movie.Religion, prophecy and destiny are heavily featured as the main themes. Paul is concerned that blind religious fanatics will do too much while following him, when he only wants to settle down as one of the Fremen. The entire Bene Gesserit faith, with the devious Reverend Mother in the lead, uses those themes as a way to control and direct all of the ways of the empire. These were touched on in the first film, but now we get to see how they play out.I won't spoil anything, so there's not much else left to say other than run, don't walk, to the theater. Movie theaters need support, and blockbusters like this cost money to make. As a man who grew up in the 1980s and 1990s, today's fantasy, sci fi and comic book action movies are a dream come true for me. Both Dune films are epic and deserve credit for continuing to bring \"nerdy\" escapism to the forefront of people's minds when choosing a movie. Bringing the debate of prophecy and action taken, as a chicken and the egg commentary, is also welcome because the fans have always known how deep these stories can get.Last comment: Don't drink anything before hand.

{"id": 314, "title": "Stunning, but story could be tighter", "content": "This is a truly amazing movie that showcases Villeneuve's artistry on multiple levels. Many storytelling choices that deviate from the book were actually smart, so a lot of thought definitely went into the script. But somehow the big picture got lost.What I found very evocative in the first Dune film by Villeneuve was Paul's struggle with his mother's vision for his life. It formed a kind of emotional core in the movie which suited the format perfectly. When you spend 2-3 hours in the cinema, you expect a certain story arc.This theme is obviously also a major red thread in the books and so continues in Part Two. But all the spectacular imagery, music and ethos does not make up for the rather wooden character development of Paul. Timoth\u00e9e Chamalet is a fantastic actor so you follow the story anyway. The film would have been so much stronger though if his evolution from troubled teen to messianic warlord were just a little more carefully crafted in the script.This shortcoming is also visible in Paul's relationship with Chani. On many levels their romance is very plausible and compelling. Towards the end of the film, the mystery wrapped around Paul's destiny inevitably comes between them. But there is so much storytelling potential in this emotional timebomb that just seems to fall flat.Besides these and other minor flaws, there are so many reasons to see this film. Some of my favorite moments are delivered by the actors Rebecca Ferguson (Lady Jessica), Zendaya (Chani), Stellan Sk\u00e5rsgard (Baron Harkonnen) and the chilling Austin Butler (Feyd-Rautha).", "rating": 7, "sentiment": 1, "date": "10 March 2024", "name": "dpsteel"}

The cinematography is gorgeous, the music and sound eerie and unsettling at all the appropriate moments, the direction is wonderful, and the characterization brilliant, the plot follows the spirit of the books. If you are a fan of the books, there are certain critiques to be had, which are valid from a fan who knows what they're talking about. However, if you are to introduce a newbie to Dune...Part 1 and Part 2 here are a great way to do so. I can't imagine how many people will read the Dune series because of this film. Watching Paul's character arc is worthwhile and satisfying and the main thread of the film. The supporting cast/characters arguably steal the show, which says a lot about them because Chalamet did wonderfully. And yes, all the disappointed Zendaya fans from Part 1 for her lack of screen time, you get to see more of Zendaya in this one. There are twists and turns in the story that will keep you guessing and even leave you feeling deeply unsettled because, well, that's Dune's story. The fight scenes have intense tension, characterization, storytelling, and drama. This movie is a classic in the making, and a sight to behold!

{"id": 324, "title": "I was disappointed", "content": "A summary of my 2021 DUNE PART 1 Review: The reason to see this is its looks. It is - I apologize - a feast for the eyes. Plot-wise we've got warring intergalactic families fighting over the rights to the universe's most important mineral: 'Spice'. We have a good son with a mysterious mother, we've got evil villains (Harkonnens), and a rebel army (Fremen) with pet worms standing guard. Even so, better to lower your expectations. The giant worms ain't that much. The bald villains are too easy confused with one another. David Bautista is the one recognized villain, but he's weak in his role. The film is somber, morbid, heavy; not a light moment throughout its long running time.Dune Part 2 is better. First, the plot is more compelling. The reasons for events in Part 1 are explained here. There is a love angle between the good son Paul Atreides (Timothee Chalamet) and a young Fremen woman Chani (Zendaya) which relieves the solemnity. In fact the very presence of Zendaya's character lifts the film mightily; she is without question someone to care about.Javier Bardem is great as the leader of The Fremen. Josh Brolin is rousing as Chalamet's protector. Austin Butler as the psychopathic next-in-line for the throne receives an A+ for creepiness (a compliment). Christopher Walken is wasted as the Emperor who is, no pun, wasting away. Why he was chosen for this role beats me. Florence Pugh as his daughter is simply 'there'. Her character is a sometimes narrator; the 'sometimes' element simply confusing. Overall there is an aura of self-importance about Dune 2, as though the viewer will take away an important lesson. But again, the heaviness, the weight of the characters' unhappiness, overpowers the 'good' that might be derived.In Part 2 many of these characters have secrets, as well as secret motives, though I, for one, was never quite sure about whose motives (with the exception of Chani's) were worth rooting for. The special effects here were disappointing; the worms were an improvement over Part 1, though seriously, I wanted to see more of them; ascertain how large they are, see them compared to other large structures. But no. I was never enthusiastic about the interstellar spacecraft; they appear more like a deck of playing cards than a speedy conveyance.Bottom line: Part 2 is a good film.

The vast majority of the poor reviews come from hardcore book fans (disclaimer: I'm one) complaining about variations from the book.

Decisions were made by Villeneuve to suppress elements that are present on the book to allow a better flow of the story without compromising its main plotline. He has succeeded in my opinion. Including all the components of the book would inevitably lead to underdeveloped storylines. Another reason for one of his most criticized decisions is obviously technical. Yes, I'm talking about a certain key book character that \"appears\" in a different way in the movie. This character would have to be done in CGI or with an actor dubbing another.

The plot is dense, so many things happen in this movie that it almost feels bit to quickly narrated at times - albeit never \"rushed\". The reason why nothing feels rushed is due to the unparalleled visual spectacle that is Dune: Part Two. Large-scale battles, dense fight scenes, but also sweeping landscape shots and close-up moments between characters are all set into scene so stunningly, I truly think it's the best looking sci-fi movie of all time. And not only the cinematography is breathatking and epic, everything around it is, too: The costumes, the epic soundtrack and, espcially, the sound design. The whole sensory experience is so weighty and well-built.I also appreicate the daring choices of color grading which give the movie a welcome artistic element.For me, Dune: Part Two got stronger as it progressed. While some character arcs were told a bit quick, they did make sense in the end and lead to a more-than-epic climax and conclusion. I really hope a Part Three will be greenlit, I feel like I am anything but tired of watching the world of Dune unfold out of Denis Villeneuve's hands.", "rating": 9, "sentiment": 1, "date": "7 March 2024", "name": "jamheigei"}
{"id": 331, "title": "A Breathtaking Conclusion to Book 1", "content": "Never before have I been this excited for the release of a film. When the delay from November to March for Part Two's release happened, it devastated me. But now it is here. I was able to see it almost a week early and it did not disappoint. I am an avid fan of the books, so I will say that most of my criticisms or slight complaints come from wishing to see scenes and characters from the book adapted on to screen, but at the same time, most if not all, of these changes make for a better paced and probably less cluttered final product.The cinematography once again is stunning. The gorgeous sands of Arrakis mixed with the colors of different times of day, the larger than life presence of the sandworms, the dismal and brutal gray of Giedi Prime, the various sietches and places of the Fremen. All of it looks gorgeous. The Hanz Zimmer score returning, capturing perfectly the atmosphere of this desert planet. Loved all of it.The performances of characters evolve, most notably Timothee as he becomes Paul Muadib and Lady Jessica as she takes on role of Reverend Mother. Zendaya as Chani gives much-needed depth to that character from the book, Javier as Stilgar was incredible. Each performance was fantastic. Dave Bautista also shines in his role as Beast Rabban. I could go on and on about each performance, but another well done aspect of this film.If you enjoyed Dune Part One in any capacity and long to see where the story of Paul Atreides and the Harkonnens goes from here, you will definitely enjoy this film as the pacing feels very quick and action packed and the world-building from Part One makes it all pay off here.So many scenes from this Part Two took my breath away and I think Denis did an incredible job adapting the second half of this epic story, despite several changes from the source material. I will definitely see this film again and again, so I can relive this incredible cinematic experience and if you haven't already, definitely give the books a try, and I look forward to the next chapter: DUNE MESSIAH.", "rating": 9, "sentiment": 1, "date": "26 February 2024", "name": "mrgulpin"}

The visuals and CGI in this film were excellent and it was cinematographically better than Dune Part 1 even. A lot happens in this movie story-wise and the pacing was very good. Denis Villeneuve uses beautiful filmmaking techniques and the end result is just stunning. The contrast between one black and white scene and the rest of the movie being colored was a brilliant move and really leaves the audience's mouth hanging and hair standing up in suspense. There are many twists/surprises in the story and they are all executed flawlessly. I never felt bored in this movie. The action scenes and the sword/knife fighting scenes were also very well choreographed and it was definitely refreshing to see. This movie was much better than Dune Part 1 in terms of story, cinematography, CGI, and everything else, and this movie definitely sets up Dune 3 in a perfect way. Overall, the movie was fantastic, a must-watch, and I HIGHLY recommend watching it in IMAX.\n                \n                    30 out of 47 found this helpful.\n                        \n                            Was this review helpful?

{"id": 333, "title": "Star-Wars But it's Stunning", "content": "Quite possibly the easiest rating I will have to give to any movie that comes out this year. Not only is Dune Part 2 better than it's predecessor it is better than any Si-Fi movie in the last 10 years with the narrow and arguable exception to Interstellar. If this does not speak to the magnitude of Dune Part 2 then I don't know what does because for a Si-Fi action film this is as good as it gets almost perfect with nothing I would change as the viewer some ideas of this would be the actors the use of visual affects and CGI in certain areas of the film, and even the casting was unarguable.First of all, I would like to shed light on Austin Butler, because not only was he incredible and honestly a surprise; he was absolutely terrifying, this guy made any Star-Wars villain look like a stuffed animal, if only Dune part 2 came out a few months earlier because Austin Butler would have for sure been a front runner for best supporting actor because he was just breath taking and defiantly a star in a bright room.With Austin Butler being my stand out actor I still have to mention Timothee Chalamet because again he was unbelievable on the same level as Austin Butler contrary to my earlier comments, what makes me believe this is the passion and anger in his voice was just bone chilling and almost any scene where he was ready to make a decision sent shivers down my spine because all of the plot was falling into place but it was just amplified that much more with incredible acting.Now with my actors concluded I must talk about the CGI and visual affects because Dune Part 2 would be little without them. All I can say is WOW!!! The visual affects made Star-wars and Avatar look cheap and that is saying something considering it had nowhere near as much funding and budget I mean even the scenes with the sand worms where perfect and could not look any more realistic but I can't leave it there because it doesn't stop there, the space ship although other worldly still looked like they where one hundred percent real. Dune Part 2 really was a stunning spectacle for the eyes.And for the best part of Dune Part 2, the cinematography was some of the best you will ever see in your life and I mean it no movie of film ever comes remotely near especially in the Si-Fi genre which speaks to how incredible Dune Part 2 is. Even the black and white shots looked stunning and sharper than a knife no matter what you end up watching this on it will still look beautiful. One scene in particular that stood out which was when Timothee Chalamet and Austin Butler where fighting and the camara was set horizontally perpendicular to where they where fighting and the sun was symmetrical to the middle of the screen and the glare of the sun broke out into the audience, in short because I could talk about this one scene for hours , it was one of the greatest and most captivating scenes in any movie in history, truly amazing. There is so much more to cover with the cinematography but I don't have space or time but honestly you could watch Dune Part 2 just for the cinematography and you would be impressed.It doesn't matter if you believe in the prophesy or not because one thing I can say is that Dune Part 2 is a special movie and one that does not come by very often so it needs to be appreciated because there are so many factors that make this a perfect film on it's own and a perfect sequel because facing facts it is better than Dune Part 1 but it is also better than any other movie you will go and see this year, What I am trying to say is that it will take something very special to top Dune Part 2. And with that I cannot wait for Part 3 because I am sure they will do an even better job than what has already been done, goodbye and go and watch Dune Part 2 I implore you an easy 10 out of 10.", "rating": 10, "sentiment": 1, "date": "8 March 2024", "name": "muswellmaniac"}
{"id": 334, "title": "Dune: Part Two", "content": "Dune: Part Two had a lot to do: Part One spent nearly three hours creating questions and setting up plot lines and Part Two has the challenge of bringing them all together. Asides from the in-universe questions, there were external concerns that the film had to field. Many, including myself, found the first movie to be well made but a bit hollow upon first viewing. Both the crew and the actors did well, but they occasionally seemed to show signs of struggle in terms of managing the weight of the admittedly very heavy source material. Part Two ends up doing a nice job at fielding these questions and winds up creating a well made sequel that not only improves on the first, but expands its ideas and makes them more coherent. Every aspect of the first film is done better in the second, from the visuals to the handling of the story: the transformation of Paul Atreides into Muad'Dib is done beautifully and is anchored by a strong performance from Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet. The connection between Paul and Chani is written and performed very well and the introductions of the new characters, such as the Emperor and Feyd-Rautha Harkkonen are executed smoothly. The movie seems to be much more confident in its direction than the first and that makes for a more compelling watch because the audience feels that confidence and can lose itself more easily in the on-screen universe. Technically, the film is jaw dropping and occasionally had me wondering how they managed to film some scenes. The Imax experience is extremely rewarding and I get the feeling that I maybe wouldn't have enjoyed the movie as much if I had seen it at home. The big question surrounding this movie, as well as all adaptations is, how does it compare to the original book? The film does make some big choices, particularly in regards to Alia Atreides, but I can't see how they could have managed to make the film more of a loyal adaptation without sacrificing some of its quality. So while the film may not replace the books, they are, in my opinion, a very good companion piece and a worthy adaptation. I look forward to Part Three and I am very grateful to Mr Villenueve for spearheading this project and bringing this story to life.", "rating": 9, "sentiment": 1, "date": "29 February 2024", "name": "humzahladiwala"}

{"id": 337, "title": "Beware of saviors", "content": "An absolute masterpiece.Please note, there are no plot spoilers in this review, but I will talk about some of the main themes.Okay, so...Dune: Part Two is one of the best films I've ever had the pleasure to see in a theater. I saw it in dual laser IMAX, and will see it again in 70mm IMAX. Dune: Part Two might have some of the most incredible sound mixing I've ever heard, too, at least for a spectacle and an epic. You feel it in your bones.The real reason this film is so exceptional isn't the world class filmmaking and visuals, though. It's the fact that this is a multi-layered and complex story that easily could have turned into a tedious slog, but it doesn't. In fact, ignore the fact that this is sci-fi for a moment. This story deals with some of the most interesting and universal themes imaginable. Fanaticism, faith, religion, power, love, tribalism, the rise and fall of empires. It takes an incredibly dense mythology and puts that to screen THROUGH its visuals, not in spite of them. This is how you properly adapt something from words to images.Also, look around at the world today. The themes of this story are as relevant as they've ever been. At heart, even though this is a sci-fi story, it deals with human psychology at its most primal levels. Clearly inspired by the Middle East and the Abrahamic religions, especially Islam (and also Judaism around the time of the Second Temple and early Christianity and the Bar Kokhba revolt), Dune manages to offer the same warning of the books, in perhaps an even more visceral and direct way...Beware of saviors.Holy wars have shaped the real world, yet so many sci-fi stories shy away from dealing with concepts of faith and religion. By embracing this aspect of the novels, this adaptation finds greatness. Especially among other blockbusters, this really is a unique experience. And it isn't done in a simplistic or insulting way, either. The best stories make you think and force you to engage with them, and there are layers to the characters and their struggles.This is not to say Dune: Part Two is perfect. I actually wish it was longer. The last third is a little rushed, and I love Christopher Walken but he may have been a little miscast here. However, the overall film is so exceptional, and it reaches such rarefied heights (like LOTR and Lawrence of Arabia before it), that it doesn't really matter to me that much. With that said, I've also only seen the film once so far, and am curious how repeat viewings will affect my thoughts.Also, I wish this had been made like LOTR, so Dune Messiah was coming out next year. Alas, I get why Denis needs a break from making three epics back-to-back-to-back.Speaking of, Denis is up there with the best to ever do it. Incendies, Arrival, Blade Runner 2049, Polytechnique, Sicario. Like the best filmmakers he has such range, but each film is so unquestionably his work.", "rating": 10, "sentiment": 1, "date": "2 March 2024", "name": "druss44121-1"}

The cast are all great in their roles, the special effects are the best I've seen this year and easily stand up to the best of Villeneuve's movies. Cinematography also as goos as I've seen. The costumes and makeup also add great deal to the amazing universe they've created. I really enjoyed it over all, but I have to say that I found the pacing very unusual.The first 2 hours seemed to pass along at a normal pace for this kind of movie - lots of drama and character development with interspersed action. Around when I felt that it was starting to look like the movie was starting to wrap up and was neatly building up to a cliffhanger for the next instalment, it explodes into a colossal battle scene between all of the main characters, and the movie carried on for another 30-40 mins of action and major plot turns. You could say it's a good complaint but I just felt like they were cramming in all this really important action when they really could have chopped out so much of the first 2 hours instead and had a much better, consistent action movie throughout.Also, regarding the editing - a couple of times I wasn't sure how a scene with multiple people in it instantly jumped to a scene with just 2 people in it. For example, when Paul awakens from the coma, and after he stands up after getting slapped, he looks back at his mother and it jumps from a full room to just him and his mother. This happened in at least 2 scenes with the main character Paul, and was a little confusing - almost like they were chopping out random transitional sections to shorten the movie run time.All in all, its a fantastic sequel and an enjoyable watch, but by no means a perfect movie.", "rating": 8, "sentiment": 1, "date": "2 March 2024", "name": "conorkingtuohy"}

So for the last week I've left all my thoughts to myself for me to truly think how I feel about this movie. After my first showing, I loved it but I came out with a feeling I wasn't satisfied and it's probably because of the changes made from the novel whereas today I have no doubt in my head of how I feel. This movie is perfect.There's genuinely so much I love about this that if I wanted, I could go through every single scene and say how brilliant it is. Firstly with the movie itself, the pacing is just godly. How on earth is that an almost 3 hour movie when it flies by faster than sand in the wind. Secondly the sound editing? Unbelievable. The visuals are without a doubt just the best thing from VFX to camera work to cinematography.But finally the acting is where this movie shines. Every actor is honestly carrying this movie and that's what you expect with a stacked cast like this. Timothy is the definition of Paul Atreides. He was born for this role and I pray it's his legacy because he gave it his all and more. The scene in the sietch with his fathers ducal signet is one of the best scenes I've ever seen. His acting in the final scene is academy level he at the very least needs to be nominated.Zendaya does wonders for Chani especially for me. As a huge Dune series fan, Chani is a good character but she doesn't at all stand out in the books. But when she was announced to be played by Zendaya I knew this would be a twist and man I'm happy with the way Denis took her arc. She's probably my favourite character in the movie which is saying a lot with how she's not even top 10 in the books. It's crazy how much facial expressions does and Zendaya plays that perfectly. The love she has you can read it just as well as the anger at the end. I cannot wait to see how Denis uses her in Messiah especially with how she's on a complete different path now.The final actor that really stood out for me is Austin Butler. Doesn't have the biggest screen time but his role is perfect and I knew it the moment you hear him laughing in his arena battle.

Visuals are stunning and you never seen a sand planet looking that great, and that include any Star Wars.Every actors performed great as well, and the music was fantastic. Honestly there is nothing i could complain about when it comes to everything around cinematography and production value. Best director? I could see this easily.When it comes to the story tough this is where just like the first im not totally convinced. I need to rewatch the first soon, wich i wanted to do before this sequel but lacked the time for, but from memories it was a beautifull movie with a convoluted story and i taught it was a bit hard to follow in part. I got the big lines of course but some nuances may had slept me by.This sequel is a lot more straight forward yet there is also story parts that still let me question them. Why a certain character behave a certain way, who is what again? The movie use a lot of terms that are not exactly \"rolling on the tongue\" and there is some mcguffins and other things that made me question what was going on.Im sure if i would rewatch both movies multiple times ill get a better feel and grip of the story but in the year 2024 with so much movies to watch and a pretty long run time, its not as straight forward, especially as at first sight im not \"that drawn\" on said story.All of this said tough this is NOT a bad story at all and like what i started with, the production value is epic. So giving it anything under 8 would be dishonest especially on my own rating scale. That said i can't quite bump it to a 9 because its not a movie i feel like i want to watch again and again like a Dark Knight or John Wick Chapter ...well all of them. But was it a pretty good time?

{"id": 351, "title": "Masterpiece", "content": "**A Cinematic Triumph: Exploring the Epic Sequel \"Dune: Part Two\"**\"Dune: Part Two\" emerges as a cinematic tour de force, building upon the foundations laid by its predecessor to deliver an epic saga that surpasses all expectations. Directed by visionary filmmaker Denis Villeneuve, this sequel transports viewers back to the mesmerizing world of Arrakis, weaving a tapestry of intrigue, betrayal, and heroism on an unprecedented scale.From the outset, it is evident that \"Dune: Part Two\" is a labor of love, meticulously crafted with an unwavering commitment to honoring Frank Herbert's iconic source material. The film picks up seamlessly where its predecessor left off, plunging viewers into a world on the brink of war as the battle for control of Arrakis intensifies.One of the film's greatest strengths lies in its masterful storytelling. Villeneuve deftly navigates the intricate narrative threads, balancing exposition with heart-pounding action to keep viewers on the edge of their seats. Each character is given ample room to grow and evolve, their motivations and conflicts explored with depth and nuance. Whether it's the charismatic Paul Atreides grappling with his destiny as the prophesied messiah or the enigmatic Lady Jessica torn between loyalty to her son and the Bene Gesserit sisterhood, every character feels fully realized and essential to the story's unfolding drama.Visually, \"Dune: Part Two\" is nothing short of breathtaking. The sweeping vistas of Arrakis, brought to life with stunning practical and visual effects, serve as a mesmerizing backdrop for the film's epic narrative. From the towering sandworms that roam the desert to the intricately designed fremen sietches, every aspect of the world-building is executed with meticulous attention to detail, immersing viewers in a universe that feels both fantastical and eerily familiar.At the heart of the film lies its exceptional ensemble cast, led by the incomparable performances of Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet and Rebecca Ferguson. Chalamet brings a quiet intensity to the role of Paul Atreides, capturing the character's internal struggle with poise and conviction. Ferguson, meanwhile, delivers a standout performance as Lady Jessica, infusing the character with a complexity and strength that elevates her beyond the typical archetype of the genre.Supporting performances from the likes of Oscar Isaac, Zendaya, and Javier Bardem further enrich the film's tapestry, each actor bringing depth and gravitas to their respective roles. Whether it's Isaac's portrayal of the noble Duke Leto Atreides or Bardem's charismatic turn as the fremen leader Stilgar, every character leaves a lasting impression, contributing to the film's rich and immersive world.Yet, perhaps the most remarkable aspect of \"Dune: Part Two\" is its thematic depth. Beneath its epic spectacle lies a poignant exploration of power, religion, and the consequences of unchecked ambition. As the various factions vie for control of Arrakis, the film forces viewers to confront uncomfortable truths about human nature and the corrupting influence of power. It's a timely and thought-provoking commentary that resonates long after the credits roll, inviting viewers to ponder the implications of our actions in an increasingly complex world.In conclusion, \"Dune: Part Two\" stands as a triumphant achievement in modern cinema, a sprawling epic that dazzles the senses while challenging the mind. With its masterful storytelling, breathtaking visuals, and stellar performances, it cements Denis Villeneuve's status as one of the preeminent filmmakers of our time. For fans of science fiction and cinema alike, \"Dune: Part Two\" is an experience not to be missed-an unforgettable journey to the heart of Arrakis and beyond.", "rating": 10, "sentiment": 1, "date": "29 February 2024", "name": "aldifauzan-13201"}

{"id": 354, "title": "Worth watching, not praising", "content": "Before you call Dune Part II 'the best Sci-fi movie' or even just a 'masterpiece' try and consider the 5 bullet points I've made below - you might even end up agreeing with some of them ;)Beforhand let me just point out that the movie was extraordinary beautifully filmed with goosebumpy music added to a dozen of memorable shots, hence the good rating. So yeah, it is a great movie with great acting. It's actually a really good movie. But that has been pointed out by a LOT of people already. Let me tell why this isn't in the 10/10 league.1. The major problem: Pacing. 2 parts of the movie, which could have been legendary, ended up being rushed: The battle of the Sardaukar and Fremen and Paul's first time riding the Worm-metro.You don't have to be a criticizer of the movie to admit, that the last fight with Fremen and Sardaukar was so shy of what it could have been. The fremen just sweeps away the emperor's army (I mean come on) in around 10 minutes of screentime. This is what the whole movie leads up to. 10 minutes. And not 10 nail-bittering minutes with an epic battle. Just 10 minutes of one side slaughtering the other. I get that they took them by surprise, but please. It would have added film value to get a tense fight, where you actually wonder whether or not they will succeed. Instead of getting a edge-of-your-seat moment, we got the predictable outcome. It feels like Denis was told to compress the last 1/3 of the film - making it as anticlimactic as possible.The sandworm-ride did make a good scene, but you don't actually see any training whatsoever. So instead of getting psyched up by him succeeding, you end up thinking; could he do this all the time?2. Paul's metamorphose to become the chosen one - or rather the absence of it. Why can't this guy admit that there might be something to the prophecy. I get that his humility is what makes him adequate for the part, but because of his continuing denial of the prophecy, we as audience too lose faith in him as the Kwisatz Haderach. Which, just like the incident of him learning to sandworm-ride, makes an unfulfilling, anticlimactic and awkward transition.3. The weak villains. I was expecting a lot from the villain-side, after Dune 1 where the emperor and baron felt clever and sly. Feyd had a great portrayal in the movie though, but the rest of them seemed frivolous. Seriously, how did the emperor manage to keep his throne for that long, with an army, that with a little surprise, breaks like glass. And Rabban is apparently just a joke despite him actually being sort of scary in Dune 1.In general the Harkonnens seem off by a lot! They get toyed around on multiple occasions, and we in the audience never actually see them as a threat due to their weak portrayal. (We mostly see them kill poor employees)4. Chani and Paul had zero romance. Sorry, but it's true. I want to see them as this meant-to-be couple, but we literally only see them bonding a couple of times. I made the assumption that Chani must be bi-polar; the girl is crazy careful and suspicious of other people several times in the movie, but starts a relationship with Paul based on 2-3 scenes with interaction. People on Tinder tend to talk more with each other before jumping into bed than these two.5. The political aspect - or once again the absence of the same. We hear about these other houses as dangerous and powerful, but where are they? As a viewer who hasn't read the books, I do not have the slightest idea of what these other houses are capable of. This is probably the main reason of the incomplexity of the plot. We don't any political reflections or responses, despite the fact that it must mean a great deal! Without the tangled political game (which I guess is pretty damn important in a world run by houses) the plot becomes predictable on a level which compares to most superhero-movies.Imagine that we had seen the other houses and their beautiful planets. Now THAT would be sci-fi in its glory!!Consider that I had so much against the storytelling (which is the fundamental part of a film) yet still gave it 8/10. I'm surely also going to see it in theaters at least one more time. That goes to show how brilliant the cinematography actually was!

He has in him a powerful masculine voice and is able to deliver combat sequences well.

Even the iconic moment of riding the sandworm seemed a bit rush and then when the moment arrived it was a bit of a let down. Don't get me wrong, visually appealing and great technical work. But the story which was written by a grand master of Science Fiction was given short shift. Hard to believe that in an almost 3 hour movie a lot of what made Dune great was given rudimentary mention or skipped all together.

{"id": 359, "title": "Everything That Film Can and Should Be", "content": "Dune: Part Two represents cinema in its purest form and is proof, more than ever, that it is alive and thriving for as long as we have masters like Denis Villeneuve telling stories on this scale. I rarely leave a theatre feeling as though I've witnessed the birth of a new classic but Dune: Part Two does everything to ensure its place in cinema history. It's everything film can possibly be but more importantly it's everything that it should be.Villeneuve takes all of the world building and character development he established in the first film and just runs with it from the get go but not in the way that I expected. I certainly wasn't expecting a faced paced movie but I was amazed and just how much Villeneuve took his time in setting up this second chapter. We get a lot of one-on-one time with these characters both before and in between the jaw dropping spectacle on display and it represents a complexity of character and perfectly developed conflicts that we haven't seen to this degree since The Lord of The Rings.We're really about an hour in before the war that's being set up truly begins to come to ahead and because of the immense amount of time taken to build up these character and stakes nothing feels anything less than perfectly realised. Despite all the set up from the first film, Part Two effortlessly builds upon and expands this world in ways that are both visually sumptuous but also perfectly developed from a writing perspective. The visual effects are astounding, the use of scale is incredible and it has some of the best battle sequences ever put to film all of which come to ahead in an all-timer of a third act. It's one for the history books and it's only going to further cement the legendary status that this entire cast and crew are operating on.I haven't read the book because I wanted to experience this entire story through the eyes of Villeneuve and despite knowing some of the broad strokes of how this thing concluded, nothing could've prepared me for the way in which this story perfectly unfolded and was brought to a close. I left the theatre truly shaken and feeling as if I'd seen something that I couldn't fully comprehend upon a first viewing and it's already left me with a burning desire to go back and experience it for a second time. One of the highest praises I can give any film is that I'm saddened I'll never get to experience it for the first time again and I can't remember the last time I was this excited to see the conclusion of a trilogy.I definitely need time to fully digest the experience that was Dune: Part Two but as of now I can truly call it a masterpiece in every sense of the word. There's nothing present in this film that doesn't feel as if it's operating on peak form and if this whole thing doesn't represent filmmaking perfection then I don't know what does. The hype surrounding this movie did not oversell this experience at all, I don't think anything could've fully prepared me for this and I know as of now that it won't just go down a phenomenal theatre-going experience but really just a memory worth cherishing.", "rating": 10, "sentiment": 1, "date": "5 March 2024", "name": "cdjh-81125"}

There's been many through time but this one just set the bar I believe. First off you've got to see it on IMax. I don't know if the smaller screen would have the same feeling. The effects are seamless. There's nothing else to say about that. And the story is complete from start to finish. But the thing that really sets it apart is the music and sound design holding hands with the effects and cinematography. It's powerful. There were moments when I found myself mesmerized by the effects and sound and lost track of the story a bit, but the phenomenal performances by Timothee Chalamet and Austin Butler brought me right back and were quite impressive. Zendaya was equally amazing. I don't want to give much away, but there are some beautiful nods to the very first dune that David Lynch directed and I think it's actually better than the first Dune '21 Denis Villeneuve did.

In fact I love it.Dune came out as a novel in 1965, it is set in the mind bogglingly distant year of 23,352 AD : ten thousand years after mankind has overthrown the intelligent machines it created.The demon of AI has already been conceived and defeated. So unlike a lot of sci-fi this story is about people and not about their clever machines.It could easily have been set during the Crusades. It has grandeur, it is expansive. It is complex.It is about belief and faith, it is full of religious fervour, about survival against the odds. It is also about revenge and justice.It is about careful manipulation, sowing the seeds of prophecy; nurturing it , of plans that span 90 generations. About knowing when to seize the moment when that time finally comes.But at the same time it is about a hero fully aware of what destruction that may bring.Dune is influential.If you've watched the Star Wars films, Dune's reluctant hero living on a desert planet with a looming empire and the battle for the galaxy will feel familiar. (After the success of the first Star Wars film , Lucas termed himself too big to sue).I have read Dune many times. I have watched the David Lynch film more times than I can remember. In fact I have watched Dune part one about five times.The casting in this version is perfect. The effects are impressive and on the big screen the sound immersive and there is some really quite striking imagery.Dune has almost become a holy book for the sci-fi fan of a certain age, it even has a messiah. I am that kind of fan. Watching it has become a religious experience. You feel like you are watching the prophecy you know so well come true. That makes it powerful.That makes Dune part two simply superb.", "rating": 10, "sentiment": 1, "date": "4 March 2024", "name": "gwhite-99165"}

{"id": 367, "title": "Dune 2: A Masterpiece of Sci-Fi Cinema", "content": "Dune 2 is a stunning sequel that delivers on the promise of the first part and takes the epic sci-fi saga to new heights. Director Denis Villeneuve has crafted a visually spectacular and emotionally gripping film that explores the themes of destiny, power, and resistance in a complex and fascinating universe.The film picks up where the first one left off, with Paul Atreides (Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet) and his mother Lady Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson) joining the Fremen, the native people of the desert planet Arrakis, who are fighting against the brutal rule of the Harkonnen family. Paul is seen by some Fremen as their prophesied messiah, the Kwisatz Haderach, who will lead them to freedom and glory. However, Paul is also haunted by visions of a bloody future that he may not be able to avoid.Dune 2 expands the scope and scale of the story, introducing new characters and locations that enrich the world-building and the plot. We meet the mysterious Bene Gesserit sisterhood, the powerful Emperor Shaddam IV (Christopher Walken), the cunning Feyd-Rautha Harkonnen (Austin Butler), and the fierce Fremen warrior Chani (Zendaya), who becomes Paul's love interest. We also travel to different planets, such as the water-rich Caladan, the industrial Giedi Prime, and the imperial Kaitain.The film is a feast for the eyes and ears, with stunning cinematography, production design, costumes, and special effects. The desert landscapes of Arrakis are breathtaking, the sandworms are awe-inspiring, and the space battles are thrilling. The film also boasts a phenomenal score by Hans Zimmer, who creates a haunting and immersive soundscape that blends orchestral, electronic, and ethnic elements. The film is best experienced in IMAX, where the sound and the visuals are amplified to create a truly immersive experience.The film also features excellent performances from the cast, who bring depth and nuance to their roles. Chalamet is superb as Paul, portraying his inner conflict and his growing charisma and confidence. Ferguson is equally impressive as Jessica, who balances her maternal instincts and her loyalty to the Bene Gesserit. Zendaya is captivating as Chani, who shares a strong chemistry with Chalamet and adds a touch of romance to the film. Bardem, Skarsg\u00e5rd, Bautista, and Butler are also memorable as the Fremen leader Stilgar, the grotesque Baron Harkonnen, the savage Beast Rabban, and the sinister Feyd-Rautha, respectively.Dune 2 is not a film that tries to please everyone. It is faithful to the source material by Frank Herbert, which means that it is complex, dense, and challenging. It does not shy away from the dark and violent aspects of the story, nor does it simplify the political and religious implications. It also does not offer a conventional or satisfying conclusion, as it is only the second part of a planned trilogy. However, for those who appreciate the vision and ambition of Villeneuve and Herbert, Dune 2 is a masterpiece that deserves to be seen on the big screen.", "rating": 10, "sentiment": 1, "date": "1 March 2024", "name": "dominikbech"}

{"id": 373, "title": "Im in the minority, but I hated it.", "content": "So I walked out the cinema around 2/3rd through, unable to watch any more. I had seen the odd review, that was overwhelming positive for it. I watched the first one, it was okay but found it boring. Im a trekkie by nature so thought I would love anything sci-fi. I did notice that it's scheduled for a streaming / blu ray release in just three weeks time, essentially killing the cinema even more. In my screenings on opening week, with 241 ticket offers on, there were six people in the theatre. So how it has reported making so much money in just days of its release is \"questionable\".But I went into this hoping I would like it. I didn't it. It was just so boring. Which is odd as there are action scenes, but none of it made any sense. I have not read the book but the rebels had around ten people in at the start, and I left when the main protagonist said he had 200. Even though most of them we saw die in the raids. Where did the extra people come from? Why were they joining when they were being killed off so often? None of this is explained.There are plot holes galore, as though entire pages of the script were just emitted in editing. For example, Wonka (because I don't know his Dune characters name) was handed a backpack of food and a tent and sent to start walking across the dessert. The very next scene, Mary-Jane is sat at the top of a sand hill talking to him. The tent is never set up, no food eaten. He's just suddenly back at camp?!There is a scene when all the guards have laser guns, and wasps with shields, but are all taken out by people with knives who can somehow see in a sandstorm and not be affected by it at the same time. It makes no sense.Then we have the worm summoning ground-pumper. Why not use it on one of the convoys and just send a worm into it? Why risk people's lives when you have that technology? Or why not ride a worm into the convoy? And how do you get off the worm after you've finished with it? None of this is explained.Then we have the \"big\" bad guy, who kills all his servants for fun. Yet more servants keep showing up? Why would anyone ever work for him? What does he do to earn his role?Why does his nephew's fight scene turn the film to black and white? Its this a students arthouse film? It makes no sense! Not to mention the fight is pathetic. They have to drug his opponents, who have tiny daggers while he has two swords and a personal shield. And a bunch of security guards on standby as well. This is suppose to be entertainment?You fill in the plot holes in your mind, while watching trying to make sense of the many pages omitted. Which I think is why all the other reviewers are praising the movie like its a masterpiece. But I need the story to take place on the screen, not in my mind.I know I'm in the minority in my thinking on this film, and all my favourite Youtube reviewers are praising it. But I just had to come on here and give my thoughts to balance out all the positive. Also, it costs a lot of money to go to the cinema and walking out of a film is not fun. When it's due for streaming release in just a few more weeks, I think you would be better to wait until then and save yourself the money. It's defiantly a film you can watch while playing on your phone, as three hours of two teenagers talking and shots of sand, while a foghorn bursts in your ears is not for me at least.", "rating": 1, "sentiment": 0, "date": "7 March 2024", "name": "kuuk3"}

The opening scenes set the right tone, promising an adventure that's both grand and intimate.The Positives:\nThe cinematography was breathtaking, with every shot from the closeups to long shots. The scenes enhanced with CGI created a visually stunning spectacle. The saturated orange hues of the desert scenes were particularly striking, evoking a sense of awe and wonder. Moreover, the inclusion of black and white scenes added a dramatic flair that was both unique and mesmerizing.Florence Pugh, even though she had limited screen time, delivered a performance that was nothing short of spectacular, bringing depth and nuance to her character.Hans Zimmer's score was a masterpiece, echoing the intensity of \"Oppenheimer\" at times that brought tension to the most important scenes, yet standing strong on its own merits. The action sequences with Zimmer's music were intense and brutal, making every moment on screen evident. The sound design, complete with peculiar yet striking effects and risers, was impeccable, enhancing the atmosphere and the tension of the narrative.The costume design was another highlight, especially with the one villains' outfits being memorable for their intricate detail and the other villain costumes which were an occasional minimalist ensemble that added a unique flair.I appreciated the diversity of languages used in the film, adding layers of authenticity and depth to the world-building.Themes of religion and politics were woven seamlessly into the storyline, adding a rich layer of complexity. The voiceover narration added a personal touch, drawing me deeper into the narrative.The Mixed:\nWhile Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet's performance had its moments, it felt somewhat lacking in emotional depth, resulting in a portrayal that felt a bit mediocre at times. The character development was uneven, with some arcs feeling rushed and others vague, which detracted from the overall impact of the narrative.Moreover, the portrayal of the villains was, on one hand, visually stunning, but, on the other hand, the acting was disappointingly generic, with their defeat feeling inevitable and lacking in suspense.This film overall managed to be complex and chaotic, which was challenging for me to watch and comprehend the details, yet, still utterly captivating, and it felt like a horror film.The Negative:\nUnfortunately, similar to the previous installment - \"Dune: Part 1 (2021)\" - the direction and pacing of \"Dune: Part 2\" were its weakest points. The storyline felt scattered, with moments of confusion and rushed character development. Despite the improvements in pacing compared to the first film, it still struggled to maintain a cohesive narrative flow.Conclusion:\n\"Dune: Part 2\" is a film of contrasts, where breathtaking visuals, outstanding performances, and a mesmerizing score stand against the challenges of pacing and narrative cohesion. Despite its flaws, it remains a breath of fresh air in the landscape of modern cinema, offering a complex and immersive experience that's hard to forget.My rating of 8/10 reflects this dichotomy: a recognition of its unparalleled achievements in cinematography, music, and thematic depth, tempered by the critical weaknesses in narrative cohesion, storytelling and character development.Rating: 8/10.", "rating": 8, "sentiment": 1, "date": "2 March 2024", "name": "sinscopefilms"}

As the story unfolds, it poses thought-provoking questions about the nature of leadership, the consequences of choice, and the interconnectedness of all life.In conclusion, Dune 2 is a triumph on every level.

{"id": 398, "title": "In The Shadows of Arrakis Lie One Secret... Dune 2 Is a MASTERPIECE", "content": "The film starts exactly at the moment the first part ended. Although according to Villeneuve it is designed to be understood without having seen the first part, I highly recommend watching Dune: Part One before.The first half of the film is poetic. Great shots of the desert. Developing new characters (especially Fremen) that we had seen briefly in the first part and, above all, we can see an evolution of some characters that we already knew. I highlight here the character of Stilgar (Javier Bardem) and Chani (Zendaya), who undoubtedly gets one of the great performances of the film. Bravo to Villeneuve for having developed Chani's character (wasted in Herbert's novel), here Chani shines until the end. Bardem, is also a fundamental piece that gives freshness to the serious and majestic plot, adding dynamism and even funny moments.The second half of the film goes to Paul Atreides. I can't say too much here, only that we see one of the greatest evolutions of a character that I've been seen in cinema. The last 45 minutes of the film are simply some of the best I have ever witnessed on a screen. Everything that was harvested in Dune: Part One now makes complete sense. The characters of Florence Pugh and Austin Butler stand out, the first one, in the background but being a totally key character, especially for everything that is going to come (Messiah); and the second one for his excellent performance as a villain (far above the Baron, a villain who personally never convinced me).All of this is great, however, an element of equal importance to everything mentioned was: the music of Hans Zimmer. Spectacular songs and sounds that make you simply feel vibrate (literally... if you see it in Imax) every moment inside you. It is no coincidence that Nolan's best films have Zimmer's seal. His music creates art. His music creates blockbusters. Not because it's commercial, but because it creates emotions within you. Every note, sound and song are placed at the right time and moment in the film. Hans Zimmer's music is undoubtedly the specie, the Water of Life... of Dune: Part Two.With all this we are left with what is not only the best science fiction film ever created, but what is (be careful what I am going to say) the best film of this 21st century (at least to date), with permission from the Dark Knight and Interstellar.Villeneuve gives us a great masterpiece. Here, however, the Messiah is not Paul Atreides, nor Villeneuve himself... The Messiah is the spectator. You. This film will push you to be a better you, it will make you dream big, it will remind you that, like Paul, you can decide when to lead your life and inspire others. You are the Chosen One to, within a simple movie, find the Gold that will make you better in your daily life.This valuable lesson is not achieved by ordinary pieces of art, but only by a few works... which some of us dare to call...

the direction on a microscale is great because it is less Sci-fi/formulaic this time as the scenes touch on more messiah/prophecy-like meanings and how this power leads to corruption; the direction of actors is better this time as you really see every performance get elevated as each actor truly feels like they are serving their purpose; the storytelling has tones to both sci-fi epics as well as messiah/prophecy-like stories, and Villeneuve tells these tones on a grand scale; Villeneuve builds tension very well as he uses sound, action, scale, and story to showcase how epic this sequel is, building on everything the first film established), Good to Very Good Acting (Very Good from Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet (For the first half of the movie, it was hard to believe him as Paul Atredies, but after one scene, there is a full 180-degree switch where he fully immerses himself as the Lisan al Gaib and carries the movie to the finish line), Good to Very Good from Zendaya (Plays an integral part in buttressing Chalamet's performance in becoming one with the Freman, and does so by establishing good chemistry between the two; in her solo moments, she shows off in portraying her disbelief in the messiah as she as her character is more of a realist), Very Good from Rebecca Ferguson (Has both motherly and antagonistic characteristics throughout the movie as her character is someone who can simultaneously help and hurt the protagonist, and by the end, she fully immerses herself in her role), Good to Very Good from Josh Brolin (Plays a fatherly figure to Chalamet 's character well and still shows how he is a loyal solider to the House of Atreides), Good to Very Good from Austin Butler (Really embodies that his character is the heir to the Harkonnen throne as he does a good job at being a sociopathic antagonist), Good from Florence Pugh (Really isn't given that much to work with but does a good job at being a central figure in her scenes), Pretty Good from Dave Bautista (Shows status in a lot of his scenes, but he is very over-the-top in a lot of moments, and he isn't given much to work with by the time the climax arrives), Good from Christopher Walken (Literally just plays Christopher Walken), Pretty Good from L\u00e9a Seydoux (She's in the movie for like 2 scenes), Good to Very Good from Stellan Skarsg\u00e5rd (Carries over where he left off in the last film as he does a good job in showing the greed of the House of Harkonnen), Very Good to Great from Javier Bardem (The best performance in the movie as you really believe that he is a believer in the Lisan al Gaib prophecy and will do everything he can to help Paul achieve that potential, filling the void Duncan, Leto, and Gurney left in the first film; shows a wide range of emotions and can seamlessly transition from humorous to anger to infatuated in a second), Pretty Good to Good from the rest of the cast (Everyone does their job as you can see different sides of the spectrum on the belief of Paul as the Lisan al Gaib/Heir to the Atredies throne)), Very Good to Great Story (The concept carries out the intended purpose of the second half of the book as it follows Paul's journey in becoming the Lisan al Gaib (and does so in a way that mixes Sci-Fi elements with religious elements), and the film stays pretty true to the source material and only deviates to better fit the narrative that Villeneuve crafted; the plot structure is great for the most part as the movie itself has its own plot, but also benefits from having there be little needed exposition as that was the intent of the first film (this film picks up right where it's predecessor left off); the main issue with the plot structure/runtime is that the film felt too short as 20-30 minutes could have been added to help slow scenes down and show how epic this movie is (especially in the climax as it feels shorter than it needed to be); flow between sequences is very good as each sequence feels connected to the last (though these sequences could have been slowed down to emphasize the sequence's importance to the story); the character writing is great as you see the impact the conflict has on the characters and how they react (with character's blindly following this prophecy and some even being corrupted by it by taking advantage of this new found power)), Great Screenplay (The dialogue is a lot more polished this time around as it sounds less Sci-Fi heavy and more realistic; the humor is used well throughout the movie (and this is mainly from Stilgar/Javier Bardem's character); the symbolism is incredibly profound as you can see the metaphors to Biblical/Prophecy-like Messiahs aiming to free people, and this movie goes one step further by showing how this power can lead to corruption and losing morals; the foreshadowing is executed well as it helps show this concept of the corruption of power as Paul is scared to be the Lisan al Gaib because of what it might do to his morals, and this also shows the relationship Paul will have with the Freman and the other houses), Great Score (Used very well to build the world and used more to build tension than last time, but it just feels like he reused a lot of the same themes as last time), Brilliant Cinematography (A technical benchmark as the movie is shot entirely in the IMAX, and they use this effectively as it helps show how grand of an epic this movie is, especially in the large crowd scenes and the colossal battles; the coloring/lighting they used in many of the scenes were stunning and rival some of the shots from Blade Runner 2049 (especially in the Gladiator scene and the final fight)), Incredible Sound (Does an amazing job in setting the tone, showing how grand this epic is, and displaying the weight power has on followers (especially from Paul's perspective)), Incredible Editing (Carries off where the previous film left off as it helps show how so many small pieces come together to make this grand epic; Used effectively well in the interpersonal scenes to show how the visions of grandeur affect the characters), Incredible Visual Effects (Helps show how grand the epic is and is seamlessly used amongst the real world, making it feel like you are transported to Arrakis), Great to Incredible Production Design (Continues where it left off as it helps portray the vastness of Arrakis and how grand this movie is with its sets and design; pulls a lot from Ancient Middle Eastern/Egyptian culture to show the beliefs of the characters and how they are waiting for the Lisan al Gaib to save them), Great Makeup (Improves from the last film in helping showcase traditional Sci-Fi elements (like with the blue eyes and the Harkonnen), but feels even more polished this time), Very Good Costumes (Continued where it left off last time), Pacing is a bit too fast as the movie breezes through its runtime by going through as much plot as it can, and this leaves you wanting more because it does not give you enough time to sit with what was going on (I would have liked 20-30 minutes to help slow the pace down), Climax is incredibly grand and the best part of the movie as the whole final hour of the movie feels like everything was clicking as we got to see how grand this epic was with its large-scale fights and sets, but it feels a bit too short and could've benefited from a longer runtime to elongate come of the abrupt fight scenes, Tone is more biblical in nature this time around as you saw the impact the prophecy of the Lisan al Gaib had on the characters, but there are still many scenes where it still has Sci-Fi tones, This movie improved on almost every aspect from the previous film and is setting the groundwork for 'Dune: Messiah' to be even more grand and epic, but even if this was the last movie, I would have been satisfied where they left the movie off; the film being shot in IMAX truly is an achievement in itself and will set the trend for more films to follow; With Oppenheimer, this movie is now making going to the movies in IMAX a true spectacle (as if you were going to a concert)", "rating": 9, "sentiment": 1, "date": "29 February 2024", "name": "cinemapersonified"}
{"id": 400, "title": "An Epic Sci Fi Film", "content": "A few years ago we got the first part of Denis Villeneuve's interpretation of Dune and I enjoyed the film though I thought it was a bit overrated. Well, now Dune: Part 2 has hit the cinemas and I have seen it so here is my review. The premise of the film sees Paul Atreides align himself with the Fremen in order to try and get revenge against the people that destroyed his family legacy.Main Character\nTimothee Chalamet plays Paul and he is brilliant in this film. His character has a great stroy arc throughout this film and feels like a natural continuation from the first film and this is such an interesting character fuelled by a great performance. This is a huge cast but Chamalet stands out and definitely holds the weight of being the lead actor on his back very well.Supporting Characters\nThis film has a big cast with big stars throughout and I am sure I will not be able to mention all of them but I just want to start here that everybody in this film does a stellar job and there isn't a bad performance here.Zendaya plays Chani, after her small role in the first film she gets way more to do here and I really liked her performance. She is a great companion to Paul but I also really like her individual journey that the character goes through. It is nice to see Zendaya deliver some impactful scenes here and give a great performance.Rebecca Ferguson is back as Jessica and she goes through a real transformation here from her character in the previous film. She has had to adapt to her new surroundings and responsibilities and seeing her characters development from the previous film is impressive from Ferguson.Javier Bardem is back as Stilgar and I have to be honest he might have been my favourite character in the film. He is actually pretty funny and I really liked the relationship that he had with Paul and it makes him a great ally to him. Bardem really commits to the role and I really enjoy watching him on screen.Austin Butler plays villain Feyd-Rautha and this is a truly imposing villain. He is cold and violent making him an impressive opposition to Paul. His introduction is very memorable and Butler really wanted to make this character memorable and he really nailed it.Story\nThe story has quite a lot going on but I found it much easier to follow here. The two factions are both interesting in their own ways and I really liked the way The Fremen are showed and given loads of depth. The characters go through lots in this film and the majority of them have compelling stories over the film with a really satisfying ending to this film.Script\nThis film has way less exposition and is way easier to follow then the first part and that is because the writing is a lot better and focuses on its characters and the plights that they are going for. There are slight pieces of humour that goes well with the characters and shows their natural charisma.Style\nThis film looks absolutely beautiful. The cinematography is some of the best ever put onto film and the action sequences are really well filmed and they feel different depending on who is fighting. Also this film has an amazing use of sound and music, the score is harrowing and adds to the overall feel of the film.Overall\nOverall, Dune Part 2 is a special film and is one of the best sci fi films that I have seen in years. It is such a vast improvement on the first film and despite its long runtime I was never bored and engaged throughout and I would say that this is a must watch at the cinema.Rating - 10/10.", "rating": 10, "sentiment": 1, "date": "8 March 2024", "name": "alindsayal"}
{"id": 401, "title": "Absolutely phenomenal filmmaking. The talent of Denis Villeneuve and Grieg Fraser are in the cosmos", "content": "Wow. Just absolutely wow. This is without a doubt the greatest film so far this decade and might just be the greatest second part of a book to film adaptation since The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers. It might even be better.Everything about this movie was achieved perfectly. The quality of the cinematography was cosmic and Grieg Fraser needs to be recognised as the powerhouse of talent he is, especially when he works with Villeneuve because the grandiose of the photography of the wide shots in this film are the most vast and mind blowing I have ever seen in a movie IN MY ENTIRE LIFE!!!The musical score from Hans Zimmer was also incredible. It is very different from the first film. There is a lot less chanting and body shaking drums and a lot more focus on more somber sounding woodwind instruments like the Oboe. The main theme/motif of this film is this Oboe melody that is repeated about 4 times in the film and once again for the credits. It has been playing in my head for the past week and I fear that it may never leave. The music was hauntingly beautiful.The world building is improved to perfection in this movie and the lore is even deeper. There is more going on in the story in Part 2 and is much more deeply rooted in religious themes, symbolism and prophecy much more than science-fiction. That is my only one real gripe with the movie, it's under the Sci-Fi genre but it doesn't really fit it that well since it feels far more like a religious fable, though that's not really an official genre, isn't it.Without giving much else away, I just want to tell you to go see it in any theatre that you can.

{"id": 402, "title": "A truly magnificent cinematic experience that is meant for IMAX", "content": "With this second installment of Dune trilogy, Denis Villeneuve has surely made it clear that he's on the same level as his long term friend Nolan. With the likes of Incendies, Prisoners, Sicario, Arrival and Blade Runner 2049 already in his bag, this epic trilogy inspire from Frank Herbert's science fiction saga has made Villeneuve one of the most creative and interesting filmmaker of 21st century.Dune: Part 2 picks up from where the first one ended where Atreides house suffered betrayal from the Emperor himself and got annihilated from Arrakis by the evil forces of Harkonnen led by Baron Vladmir (Stellan Skarsg\u00e5rd). Paul Atreides (Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet) unites with Chani (Zendaya) and the Fremen army led by Stilgar (Bardem) while seeking revenge against the conspirators who destroyed his family.This parts focusses on the ways of Fremans and their obsession with the legend of Lisan-al-Gaib. Javier Bardem's portrayal of Stilgar, a Freman blinded by his faith is one of highlights of this epic. Chalamet too shines as Paul Atreides who's trying to live up to the expectations of prophesy. Austin Butler and Florence Pugh are fresh entry to this star studded franchise.As expected, you are up for a worth remembering cinematic experience with nothing but perfect visuals and soundtrack. Hans Zimmer had to break his long term collaboration with Nolan in TENNET so that he could be a part of the film adaptation of his favorite childhood science fiction novel. He surely justifies his commitment by giving some breathtaking scores.All along a must watch in IMAX screen!!!", "rating": 8, "sentiment": 1, "date": "1 March 2024", "name": "shashank_1501"}
{"id": 403, "title": "A narrative and audiovisual triumph", "content": "I didn't fully connect with the Dune universe until yesterday.The 80's version, despite being directed by David Lynch, is a fiasco in every way.And the first of this saga by Villeneuve did not move me enough. I felt it was lukewarm for the beginning of an interplanetary epic.This second part corrects all the shortcomings of the previous one and is a firm and notable step that positions the saga with the potential to become something similar to what The Lord of the Rings saga achieved.Denis Villenueve uses the concepts of the book: The Hero's Journey by Joseph Campbell with mastery and narrative eloquence:\nThe twelve stages of the hero's journey\n1. Ordinary world. The real world before the story begins.2. The call to adventure. The protagonist is presented with a problem, challenge or adventure.3. Call rejection. Fear of change causes reluctance to accept the call, a refusal to leave the comfort zone.4. Meeting with a mentor with supernatural help. The hero finds support that provides him with information and trains him to respond to the challenge.5. First threshold. The ordinary world is abandoned and the threshold is crossed into the special or magical world. The hero faces what is known as the desert crossing.6. Tests, allies and enemies. The hero encounters all kinds of trials, enemies and allies, which allows him to learn the rules of that special world.7. Approach. The hero overcomes the tests on his path.8. Decisive evidence. The most critical moment takes place, a life or death test.9. Reward. The hero has faced death and overcome the fear of it, then comes the reward.10. The way back. The protagonist has to return to the ordinary world.11. Resurrection or Enlightenment. On the way back, another decisive test takes place on his home world, the hero once again faces death using everything he has learned. The transformation is complete.12. Return with the elixir. The hero becomes aware of the acquired knowledge (power) that he uses to help others in the ordinary world.It is a paradigm that has served many visionaries as a practical guide to create their alternative universes. George Lucas has mentioned on several occasions how valuable reading Campbell was to him in laying the foundation for Star Wars.Dune 2 is visually majestic. There are memorable scenes: the giant worm cavalcades through the desert are innovative and peculiar. He knows how to take advantage of the immensity of the desert, the enigmatic nature of these extensive desert territories. The arid environment helps to understand the psychology of the characters; like Stilgar (Javier Bardem), a leader with unwavering faith.The narrative has strong religious connotations: it speaks of a Messiah, of prophecies, of mystical rituals that lead to the knowledge of profound truth, of religious fundamentalism. At the same time and inherent to any power struggle, subtle political intrigue is handled to strengthen positions and implement military strategies.All these aspects are masterfully brought together. A film of almost three hours that does not falter at any time. On the contrary, as it progresses, interest increases and narrative cohesion grows.A wonderful cast: Timothe\u00e9 Chamalet as Paul Atreides, the son of an important house banished by circumstances and who, in adversity, finds the clarity and inner strength to become a leader and a kind of messiah. Rebecca Ferguson, as Jessica, his mother, who becomes a spiritual leader known as Reverend Mother.Florence Pugh, as Princess Irulan, who will witness the collapse of the power of her father, the Emperor (Christopher Walken). That is to say, all the characters are attractive and well drawn. They feel organic and do not merely represent archetypes.Everything works fine here. The audiovisual gear provides spectacle with strong foundations supported by a deep story that makes allegories to religious and socio-political problems current in the 21st century.", "rating": 10, "sentiment": 1, "date": "9 March 2024", "name": "javierbaron2008"}

The scale of this movie surpasses everything: the action, the performances, the music; everything is perfect. The film picks up where the previous one left off to create what could feel like a war behind the screen. It feels so real; emotions flow throughout the projection, from beginning to end.We witness Paul's growth to become the promised Messiah, and as he does, the terrifying sensation caused solely by the idea of what is to come is chilling.Feyd-Rautha is terrifying in a very explicit sense; he is unpredictable and sadistic, truly relishing it, and Austin Butler portrays him magnificently. But the figure of Paul, played by Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet, feels like oppression itself, of a much more powerful and sinister evil, truly terrifying. Yet his more human side is not overlooked, as we see his suffering from the fate that falls upon his shoulders. To not dwell too much on interpretations, I must simply say that there is not a single one that disappoints; they are all truly magnificent.Hans Zimmer picks up where he left off in the Part One and elevates it, providing a sense of epicness, without neglecting the mystique. The visuals are incomparable; the effects are polished to the smallest detail, making you believe in Dune, in Arrakis, and in the entire world built by Frank Herbert, and shown through Denis Villeneuve's vision.Lastly, regarding this, it can only be said that this great director continues to improve; he always surprises for the better. With this film, he brings his sensitivity, which has already made him stand out, to tell the most epic story of his career, perhaps his greatest challenge, and he has succeeded; what seemed impossible, he has achieved.I truly feel fortunate to have seen this movie in theaters; it was a sublime experience.

Despite my lack of preparation for \"Part 2\" I came out of still full of enjoyment, but not as much as I had for the first film.The pacing for me is my biggest negative. From the appearance of what I watched there's a \"Part 3\" to come as well so this film is setting up for that. I bring that up because I didn't have as much excitement watching this movie. The final battle was enthralling, but it didn't motivate me to cheer for or against anyone.The acting was good and the chemistry carries over from what I remember. I like Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet and Zendaya, but neither of their performances really griped me for the emotional parts. There may have been moments when I felt connected, but they were stretched.Visually this film is spectacular. A lot of attention to the details is definitely display. Obviously there would've been a lot of VFX used to obtain 98% of the scenes, but it feels natural. Nothing feels overtly out of place and that includes the giant worms.The film also sounds amazing. Unfortunately the theatre I went to has a lot of blown speakers so the sound quality was less than impressive at times, but I could definitely make out what was trying to be achieved. Once again Hans Zimmer crushes the score and brings you into this vast imaginative world.Overall, despite some of my peeves I admit that it is a great movie. Not as enjoyable as the first film for me, but it's worth the time in the end. The story is good with build-up that I can appreciate. This film is more than two actors and they all nailed their parts well. The effects and sound are spectacular, but the flow of everything might throw some off. Ten minutes longer than the first film and I felt it. Still, I would see it again granted I check out the first film first.That's all for now. Thank you for taking the time to read my review.

There's something special about this cinematic experience that brings back the nostalgia of the early 2000s when the best movies came out. It's a time when anticipation built up for months, if not years, before a major film's release. I particularly enjoy that it's once again similar like back in the days when you were genuinely excited to await a movie's release. The kind of excitement that had you marking calendars and planning movie nights with friends or family. As a hard-working man, finding joy in such simple pleasures has become rare. I can enjoy a trilogy again as if I were a fan, just like in the old days, finding myself in a world so vast and stories so compelling that for a moment, the outside world fades away. It makes me feel young again, reigniting the sense of wonder and endless possibility I had back then. This movie is brilliant, not just in its execution but in its vision. I love how they incorporated Islamic prophecies. It's a testament to the film's commitment to not just entertain but to educate.

I had adjusted my expectations in advance so that I could have lived with it if \"Dune - Part 2\" had been like Part 1, with its strengths and weaknesses. In this respect, Part 2 completely disappointed my expectations... for the absolute better!In my opinion, Dune - Part 2 makes up for every weakness of its predecessor(without spoilers):Part 2 has a much better pacing and has the perfect narrative tempo. Not too fast-paced and rushed, but also not as lengthy and tough as part 1. In addition, I wasn't bored for a minute of the 166 minutes.Part 2 offers much more emotional depth in terms of the plot and the characters. I actually empathized a lot with the characters here. The feelings I had throughout the movie ranged from happiness, tension, joy, worry, fear, indignation to hope and satisfaction. Great!Part 2 has much better background music than Part 1, where I wasn't always entirely satisfied with the soundtrack. Here, however, Hans Zimmer has once again demonstrated absolute class, almost on a par with Blade Runner: 2049 or Interstellar!Part 2 contains significantly more subtext and hidden or clear and obvious messages. There is a lot to think about in the plot and dialog.The amount of action has increased significantly, but not so much that you could call it a constant barrage of action. The action scenes that can be seen are absolutely superbly staged and perfectly mixed in terms of sound. A great soundscape with a great surround backdrop. The camera work and various shots are also great. You can always follow the action scenes wonderfully and have some great perspectives that ensure that the viewer always has an overview of the action.Overall, the visual presentation is much more varied and elegant than in its predecessor. The desert of Arrakis has also been depicted much better and more authentically.In Part 2, the actors/actresses have significantly more opportunities to breathe life into their characters, which makes them much more tangible and authentic.Overall, I am absolutely thrilled with this sequel, which really puts Part 1 in the shade in all respects. My current rating shows me that I rated Part 1 too highly after all. \"Dune - Part 1\" would now only be a 7/10 for me.With Dune - Part 2, Denis Villeneuve has truly created another masterpiece.

Paul Atreides riding a Sandworm for the first timing or uniting the Fremen behind him are good examples. Timothee Chalamet fulfills the task of portraying an initially humble Messiah yearning to be equal to Fremen rather than to control them who turns into a self-righteous, self-proclaimed leader with excellence. Nevertheless, Austin Butler as Feyd-Rautha Harkonnen is the star of the movie for me personally with his unforgettable performance. He evokes feelings of repulsion and horror with ease and fully melts with the role such that I forgot that it is Austin Butler playing him. However, turning to my main issue with this movie, which cost it one Star, is the story as it has not fulfilled its potential. Focusing on the evolution of Paul Autreides in depth and showing life of the Fremen as well of the Harkonnen, the Bene Gisserit are left in the dark. Also, the purpose of having a sister remains unclear.

{"id": 447, "title": "A more than worthy conclusion.", "content": "Dune: Part 2 is an extraordinary feat of filmmaking. Director Denis Villeneuve concludes Paul Atredies' (Timothee Chalamet) story with brilliance, while never sacrificing the human and ethical elements.Part 2 picks up where the first film left off. Granted, this film isn't technically a sequel, as it continues from the first half of Frank Herbert's beloved classic. In a way, Part 2 enhances the first half due to the ramifications that follow. Paul's story of finding out if he's the chosen one while earning the respect of the Fremen - specifically Chani (Zendaya) and Stilgar (Javier Bardem) - is one of the more fascinating aspects.Paul's story is only one aspect of the narrative, as the Harkonnen family - led by the imposing Stellan Skarsg\u00e5rd - is still trying to wipe the Fremen off of Arrakis. Dave Bautista returns as the impulsive Rabban, while new addition Austin Butler plays the Baron's nephew, Feyd-Rautha - a psychotic rockstar of a character who's well-trained in combat.Butler is one of the movie's standouts. His introduction as a challenger in a gladiatorial celebration on the Harkonnen planet of Giedi Prime is one of the more haunting and unique sequences I've seen in some time. Viewers might find the villains to be one-dimensional, and in a way, they are. However, they're still imposing enough that the point comes across clearly.Familiar characters return such as Lady Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson), and others - I won't go into detail if you haven't read the book. Suffice it to say their character development is just as impactful as Paul's. This is made all the more important given the rapid pace of scenes that range from quiet and contemplative, to action-packed and invigorating.Viewers also shouldn't slouch on the technical aspects of the film. Villeneuve returns with cinematographer Greig Fraser and composer Hans Zimmer. Greig's photography rivals his previous work in such a way that he might get nominated next year. Likewise, Zimmer's score is captivating within the context of the action scenes, and emotional at the film's bittersweet ending.By the end of the film, I couldn't help but feel a sense of sadness, as I'd enjoyed being in this strange - yet captivating - universe. If you get the chance, be sure to see it on the biggest screen possible. I could go on forever about how much I loved this film, but I'll just say: go see this movie.Villeneuve has proven, yet again, why he is one of the greatest directors of our time by doing the impossible: adapting one of the most beloved, unfilmable books ever made.", "rating": 9, "sentiment": 1, "date": "3 March 2024", "name": "nicksmoviereviews"}

The beauty of Arrakis made even more dramatic by the terror of the worms and its storms.Politics is at the core of the film though and its interplay with faith, belief and religion. Paul is given a much darker turn his messianic trajectory driving a visible fall from the grace of the Fremen instead an instrument of the political long play of the true power of the Bene Gesserit.

The event of Jessica drinking the Water Of Life and then being told she should not have done so happens more or less exactly as depicted here, but we see that Alia Atreides is able to speak in whole sentences and walk unaided at ages where normal Humanoid children are struggling to make singular words and stand upright. Villeneuve's change to the story hurts it not because of anything to do with Alia, but because the timetable of Paul responding to House Harkonnen's power slap with a once-punch knockout using the Fremen as a fist becomes impossible this way. Jessica is shown being approximately eight months pregnant at the end of the film. Assuming that Paul sensed her pregnancy in the first week, this gives Paul nine months to:* Ingratiate himself enough with the Fremen for them to follow him into battle en masse* Disrupt spice production to such an extent that the reserves the Harkonnen keep are no longer enough to keep the Landsraad from taking notice* Go from indifferent to receiving offers of sex from Chani (admittedly, depending on many factors, this is plausible in the given time period)* Develop enough skill in worm riding to make the Fremen see him as their equal or even MessiahI think you see where this is going. Put simply, too many events are compressed into a small timeframe, and the credulity suffers a lot for it. Knowing that Villeneuve loves Dune, calls it Star Wars for grown-ups (and rightly so), but he could have stood to turn the first novel into a three-film series and he would still have to leave out some pieces of the story.We get a slew of new characters, including the much speculated-about Feyd Rautha, the character Sting checks under the bed for at night. If you have not seen the Flying Underpants, consider yourself lucky. Or unlucky if you are into that sort of thing. Anyway, Feyd Rautha is depicted beautifully and gets exactly the screentime he needs to fulfil his function in the story. Unfortunately, he is the only new character in this piece that we can say that about.Princess Irulan is barely developed beyond \"daughter of the Emperor\". Even her function as a historian and one of the sources people in the far future will read when seeking an account of the events in these films is something you could not possibly know of unless you read the novel. The only reason she needs to be in the story is, as said, she gets half of her DNA from the Emperor.Speaking of the Emperor, he is barely in the story. We learn that he is saddened by having had to send House Atreides to their doom, that the current unrest on Arrakis is bothering him, that it threatens his rule, but again, the only reason he cannot be cut from the story is because he has one essential function, to be overthrown, and the other details really only tie into that.L\u00e9a Seydoux gets the worst of it. Lady Margot Fenrig is so superfluous it makes me weep. The one scene she does anything in involves subjecting Feyd Rautha to the same test Paul underwent in the beginning of Part One. One could simply remove her and give this scene to Princess Irulan or some anonymous nobody character, and the impact would not change.This hurts development of a connection with these new characters, and the nearly nonexistent screen time of returning characters such as Gurney Halleck or Glossau Rabban undermines the connection we had with them if we saw them in Part One.So what makes Dune: Part Two great? The collective aspects where Villeneuve once again hits it out of the park. The conflict between believers in the religious vomit planted by the Bene Gesserit and those who see it for what it is, although not central to the story, is a steady Billy Gould bass pattern throughout the film. In spite of the mishandling of the timeline, Lady Jessica's contribution to the story is as powerful as ever. She might not be commanding huge men to kill each other, but she is having no less of an impact upon the world around her. And Paul, well, the whole story revolves around Paul now, and he tears into it like an autoimmune disorder into healthy tissue. Paul is described in the novel as being fourteen years old when first he sets foot on Arrakis, and is around seventeen to eighteen years old at the conclusion of said novel. From an emotional perspective, Paul seems to be the exception to the bungling of the timetable. But hey, moments of incredible violence and threat to one's existence age a man up a bit (I know).The choice to make all outdoor scenes on Geidi Prime an offensively bright monochrome, the return of the masterful rendition of Ornithopter wings, the fact that Villeneuve knows how to construct a scene of violence, the masterful environmental storytelling, it all comes back and reminds us of why Dune: Part One left us wanting more. The difference is that Dune: Part One left us wanting more of a story that is unassailable from a logic and worldbuilding point of view. But what we get in Part Two is still masterful. Probably my favourite aspect would be that in spite of the timeline, the actions of the characters both make absolute sense in context of their circumstances and come from a place of intelligently processing the available information. Baron Harkonnen in particular demonstrates this, by taking control of Arrakis away from Glossau Rabban and giving it to Feyd Rautha, still under the assumption that there are a lot less Fremen than is truly the case, and totally ignorant of the bucket of napalm he has kicked into a pool of nuclear waste.If you are a fan of Dune, in the sense that you get the message of the story and understand its style (hey, certain director who everyone mistakes for understanding Tolkien, it is about consequences), Part Two is a must-watch. But people who have only seen the Part One film will walk away confused by the dropping of the timeline ball, and that is a problem for people who are familiar enough with Frank Herbert's novels to know that everything Paul does in Part One, Part Two, and Part Three will have repercussions that continue for another ten thousand years.See it twice. Regardless of what I have to say, it is really good for your brain.", "rating": 9, "sentiment": 1, "date": "13 March 2024", "name": "rottentowers-63027"}

Would highly recommend to re-watch the first movie in order to appreciate the subtleties and foreshadowing better, though it's not completely necessary since the movie is pretty self-contained and would please general audience that only watched the first movie 3 years ago just as well.Denis Villeneuve continues to prove himself as one of the most promising filmmakers of our time, and if it was up to me I would keep him in these high-budget epic tales such as these since there are very few directors working today that can tackle this genre as good as he does.In my personal opinion, the movie is better than the first part in pretty much every aspect. Hans Zimmer's score is masterful just as you'd expect, and one step up from the Oscar winner and Grammy nominated score of Pt. 1. Technical aspects such as VFX, Production Design, Sound, Editing, etc. Are all top notch and awards-worthy. The action sequences are absolutely mind blowing and sent chills down my spine. Denis direction is impeccable, and the story is absolutely fascinating- continuing to develop characters from Pt. 1 even deeper and introduce new incredible and intriguing characters.The movie serves as a great wrap-up to the story introduced in Pt. 1 however in my opinion could serve as an even better set-up to a possible masterpiece in Dune: Messiah, which I really hope will get green-lit soon.I believe (and surely hope) this movie will be a major player in the next Award Season. Below-the-line wins are pretty much guaranteed right now, but I hope it will get some love in above-the-line categories such as Direction and even Best Picture, perhaps to break stigmas presented agains this Fantasy/Sci-Fi genre in recent years at the academy. As a big fan of the genre, unless a better competitor will be released later this eligibility period, perhaps it's time for a movie like this to triumph once again.Don't miss the opportunity to catch this movie on IMAX, since I believe it's an historic piece of epic-Fantasy/Sci-Fi cinema and a movie that will be remembered as a classic of the genre.", "rating": 10, "sentiment": 1, "date": "27 February 2024", "name": "abdullahsaleem-07354"}

I liked the first part for its cinematography, sound design and introduction of Frank Herbert's version of a Sci-Fi Fantasy. But the second part exceeds in nearly every aspect. Everyone liked Denis Villeneuve's \"Dune\" for establishing a modern Sci-Fi Fanatsy world but unlike Star Wars for example it was supposed to introduce to the world of Dune from the beginning; apart from the sound- and set-design and the SFX the story was rather simple. Not so \"Dune: Part Two\". The story picks up speed quickly and packs tons of plot in a short time whilst never sacraficing breathtaking and perfectly timed pictures and scenes. The cut is perfect and camera and SFX are even more astonishing than in the first film. The topics this film depicts leave extensive food for thought covering politics, mass manipulation through religion, fate and human behaviour. Personaly I sometimes thought I was presented with a summary of all \"Star Wars: The Clone Wars\" plots, which is a good thing. Maybe even including the humor; the film is funny at times, not like Marvel, but some may be disturbed by it. Personaly I was not. The only negative I noticed after finishing the film is that the score lacks a recognisable theme, the Arakis-Theme appears one or two times, but the quantity of leitmotifs isn't quite on a Star Wars level.

From the gorgeous cinematography instantly iconic in each scene to the rib breaking score by Hans Zimmer, the knee deep flood of A-list actors peppering the screen bringing every ounce of talent, this movie hits like Dark Knight, Rise of the Planet of the Apes, and Infinity War.My only grief (if I'd even call it that) is that even at 2 hours and 46 minutes this movie flies by. It's clear that a little exposition has been cut and I'm sure there's an extended cut waiting for home release as is standard for WB and Legendary. And you can tell by the brisk pacing that they needed to fit in Dune's larger world building by trimming a little fat. But for those who felt like Part I was slow, this is THE roller coaster ride. From start to finish.The conflict rages on as Paul (Timothy Chalamet) cements his position with the Fremen to gain control back for the planet Arrakis from the Harkkonians. Mentored by a budding love interest with a fierce Fremen warrior, Chani (the ever popular Zenaya), and further mentored by a senior believer Stilgar (Javier Bardem), Paul starts feeling inner conflicts of being heralded as a prophesied savior or a blasphemous interloper. Compounding the conflict is Paul's mother (Rebecca Ferguson) who has secrets to be revealed, the Harkkonians responsible for destroying House Attreides building their forces, and the emperor's decreasing grasp on Spice production. I cannot say anymore than that because it'll start spoiling the movie.Far and away my favorite scene is Paul's baptism by fire with Arrakis' native megafauna. Anybody familiar with the story knows what I mean, but it is one of those moments that you never forget. Like Arnold Schwarzenegger being pursued by a semi in the LA canal, Paul's Fremen trial will define the series.I know reviewers have already posted this, but this is this decade's Empire Strikes Back.

They spent a lot of time teaching cast members how to speak Fremen (a made up language) and how to walk without rhythm to avoid worms but they totally forgot to provide context or back story for the films.So before watching DUNE 1 and 2, watch David Lynch's 1984 DUNE Extended version (a little campy but fun) and/or read the book DUNE or at least the Wikipedia page. Also before DUNE 3, watch Children of Dune 2003.Some factoids from DUNE 1984: In 6041, the universe was ruled by thinking machines and humanity became apathetic and eventually became enslaved to these machines. A religious revolt freed humanity from the machines and forced humans to develop their minds.As the movie opens, it is the year 10,192 and the known universe is ruled by the Padishah Emperor Shaddam IV. Each major planet is ruled by the great houses of the Landsraad and their members are part of the royal families. They follow an ancient feudal system of government.Only two mental training programs remain. The Bene Gesserit sisterhood for females with their selective breeding program to produce the Kwisatz Haderach (the Super Being) as foretold in a Fremen prophecy. The other is the Spacing Guild which emphasizes pure math and with the orange spice melange produced on the planet DUNE (aka Arrakis), their space navigators are able to fold space to almost instantly transport objects with their minds which gives them an economic monopoly in the universe. The spice melange extends life, expands consciousness and is vital for space travel and must continue to flow.Two royal houses have been mortal enemies for centuries--House Atreides on planet Caladan ruled by Duke Leto Atreides and House Harkonnen (a ruthless and sadistic people) on planet Giedi Prime ruled by Baron Vladimir Harkonnen.The CHOAM company under the Emperor controls mining of the spice melange on DUNE. The Bene Gesserit and the Spacing Guild are silent partners of CHOAM. The Emperor is fearful of Duke Leto's popularity among the Landsraad and has conspired with Baron Harkonnen to eliminate the Duke and his family. The Emperor has transferred the spice mining contract from House Harkonnen to House Atreides forcing the Duke to relocate his household to Arrakis (DUNE) and become more vulnerable.The Bene Gesserit sisters can read minds, have powers of telepathy and are able to mutate with the water of life. They are trained in a method of hand to hand combat called the WEIRDING WAY and they're able to influence behavior using the VOICE.DUNE 1 & 2 follow the Fremen prophecy of the Kwisatz Haderach (the Super Being who is the hand of God).

{"id": 493, "title": "Pacing is weird, beautiful cinematography", "content": "This is actually one of the few movies where I didn't necessarily agree with the high ratings. I was very excited about this sequel. Part 1 was pretty great. I'm sad I just didn't agree with what most people thought about part 2. I enjoyed the movie overall but since I didn't read the books, I was fairly confused and bored throughout the first half of the movie (besides the beginning scene) but I really did like the 2nd half though. Probably got more interesting after Austin Butler's character rolled in, honestly. Pacing. I think the pacing was weird as they could've fleshed out the relationships, training, and yeah... basically the story more. It's just not convincing compared to the first movie. I didn't feel much for the characters nor did I care for them. I didn't even care for Chani and Paul's romance. And it's like wow.. Paul is already attempting to ride the worm? It's so dangerous and he's already succeeded on his first attempt. He's THAT gifted. There were mentions of training but really no show. I mean, Paul was basically told to survive through the dessert as a test and learns how to sand walk better but that's... it. The movie simply shows the major parts but nothing much in between to build it up. It was also like watching two different movies in one and now the \"good\" side is gonna ambush and fight the \"bad\" side. I don't feel the movie did a good job of making me want to root for Paul and the fremen. I hope I'm explaining my gripes about this film well.Many big name actors/actresses. Timothee is always a good pick for these type of roles. Austin Butler's character was cool. He did a good job with the character too. I like Zendaya but she's not that great of an actress. Dave Bautista's character was poorly written. All he does is yell and get frustrated then kills one of their own to make them look like very bad enemies. So cliche. I could also barely hear/understand some of the lines which was an irk. It was especially difficult to understand Stilgar because of the accent. The cinematography was beautifully done though.

{"id": 496, "title": "Pretty good, albeit somewhat muddled.", "content": "This won't read like a positive review since I'm going to be illustrating an element which I found unsatisfying for both this film and (to a lesser extent) the 2021 Dune, so before you read ahead, I'd just like to point out that I enjoyed the film on the whole and found it to be visually and technically impressive. It's definitely one of those \"see it in the theater\" movies which we rarely get nowadays.I've asked and have seen other people ask variations of the question \"Is Paul intended to be a power-hungry villain or a noble protagonist who genuinely wishes to help the impoverished people?\" a handful of times and have seen a variety of responses across the board. I've seen some people say he is intended to be selfish and villainous, while some other people have argued that, though he betrayed Chani in the process of reclaiming his leadership, he's still a good person and wants the best for his people.Where do I stand on this? I'm honestly not sure. I think his betrayal of Chani for one of the Shaddam's daughters is a main point of contention regarding his motivations as this is where I've read a great deal of arguments for his selfishness. As Paul explained in the 2021 Dune though, his reasoning for marrying one of the Shaddam's daughters was to hopefully prevent a civil war once news of the Shaddam's treachery would be widely known, so I don't think his actions here can be summed up in a black and white good or bad metric. They're far more nuanced.Fair arguments can be made that being more upfront with Chani about his intentions would've been the noble way to go about it since she wouldn't have been given false hopes then, but this would've also introduced the threat of her turning on him much earlier and Paul potentially losing the support of the Fremen. Either way, don't the benefits of potentially preventing a civil war and saving countless lives outweigh the disappointment he caused to a single person along the way? For a second, I was confident this was how to read his character, but then the film ends on a cliffhanger where Paul intends to have the Fremen attack the Great Houses for opposing his ascendancy to the throne. So, he is intended to be power hungry after all? What does this say about his prior actions then?This is my issue with the film. While ambiguous character motivations aren't bad by any means, this is a case where Paul's motives are so muddled to the point they seem to contradict each other. If he is intended to be a villain and if he is intended to become a dominator in the ending, that would cancel out my interpretation of his relationship with Chani and, to be honest, I don't know how I'd read their relationship at that point. If he'll be revealed to have noble intentions by the time (or if) part 3 comes out, that will make a bit more sense but then the film could be argued as a white savior trope of sorts. Still though, I think the latter alternative would be the best option provided they include enough moral ambiguities in his process of saving the impoverished people (like his aforementioned betrayal of Chani, even if there was an understandable reason why he did that). As it stands right now though, that people can't seem to agree on whether he's good or bad says a lot about how unclear his motivations are.Having watched part 1 less than a week before part 2 was released played a part in my enjoyment since I held out some confidence that part 2 would resolve my unanswered questions but it instead did the opposite. If they do manage to resolve everything in a seamless way, then kudos, but the journey leading up to it feels so muddled right now. Like I said at the start, I still enjoyed the film quite a bit and, if part 3 gets released, I'll probably be in the theaters for it. Hopefully, they're able to resolve this.", "rating": 7, "sentiment": 1, "date": "6 March 2024", "name": "brianberta"}

Its vast plot lines, characters, and lore make for a story so intriguing and epic that by 2 films, it's already competing with the likes of Star Wars. Part Two expands on everything Part One sets up and more. There's more at stake, more to unpack, and more to set up (but in the best way). The addition of new characters, more lore, and an epic set up for the future make this both a worthy conclusion of the first chapter and an incredible set up for what's to come.\"This is only the beginning.\" - ChaniMY FAVORITE CHARACTERS (LADY JESSICA):\nLady Jessica was an easy 2nd favorite of mine when it came to the characters. Like Paul, (which I'll go into later), her character grows so much from part one. She's so much more of a villain this round, and it made all of her interactions with Paul and the cast so unnerving and unsettling. The Bene Gesserit are such an interesting collection of people, and their mystique is displayed perfectly. You can never tell where Jessica or any of them align, making for some of the most interesting scenes.\"You chose the wrong side.\" - Lady JessicaMY FAVORITE CHARACTERS (FEYD RAUTHA):\nFeyd Rautha is such a brutal villain. Austin Butler is the best possible casting for this, though I also think Bill Skarsg\u00e5rd would've done great too. Though he has limited screen time, Austin as Feyd brings such a menacing presence to the screen. I'd honestly link him up with some of the greats like Heath Ledger's Joker, JK Simmons's Terence Fletcher, and Anthony Hopkins's Hannibal Lector. He carries each and every scene he's in.\"Kiss my feet!\" - Feyd RauthaMY FAVORITE CHARACTERS (PAUL ATREIDES):\nPaul Atreides goes from predictable protagonist in Part One to something so much more complex in Part Two. Going from doing whatever guides his heart to doing whatever benefits the wellbeing of the universe, Paul ascends far above hero level. Paul isn't a hero in this, he's literally a messiah. He does what is needed for the benefit of all, not just those he cares for. Dennis translates Paul's \"anti-hero\" character so well in fact, that Paul has risen to be one of favorite protagonists in all of literature.\"Lead them to Paradise.\" - Paul AtreidesMY THOUGHTS:\nI knew this was going to surpass part one, but I didn't know by how much. Dune: Part Two is genuinely one of the best movies I've ever seen. Like I mentioned in my first review, it's one of few films that I truly think deserves the word perfection. It's a masterpiece in both sci-fi and in general. It's one of the greatest science fiction films ever made, akin to the likes of The Empire Strikes Back and 2001: A Space Odyssey. It'll stand the test of time, and it'll be brought up in conversations decades down the road. I know I'm still in the Dune hype zone, but truly, this is one of the best things I've seen in a theater. If not top 5, it's AT LEAST a guaranteed top 10. Never will I recommend a film more...than Dune: Part Two.This is cinema. This is perfection.

{"id": 500, "title": "The Problem with Chani", "content": "It was a visual spectacle and refreshingly it lived up to and beyond the hype.However, for me there was a niggling itch through the movie. Something about Chani's character that bothered me and only grew as the movie progressed.I googled to see if others shared this feeling, all I could find was praise for the character. However there was consensus that she was written very different from the book.I finally found an article that helped describe the disconnect I felt with ChaniThe following is not my writing and all credit is given to Kara Kennedy - \" ...Herbert's novel Dune, Chani has a range of roles and avenues of strength, influence, and power. She becomes Paul's love but begins as the young woman who introduces him to a foreign desert land in his visions and the one who guides him as he integrates into the Fremen community. She is a fierce young fighter as well as a religious leader in her role as Sayyadina, standing apart from Paul to oversee the cultural rites. She is a young mother who finally wins the approval of her child's Bene Gesserit grandmother, Jessica, and saves Paul from a long coma. She is wise enough to understand the political necessities of Paul legally marrying a princess and trusted by him to negotiate the marriage contract.Chani's attachment to Paul is an important part of the story, but it does not reduce her to being a simple, one-dimensional female character. Chani is an essential window into Fremen culture. Her multi-faceted character challenges stereotypes about women of faith and women in non-Western cultures that continue to be debated about in the real world.Meanwhile, the films-Dune: Part One and especially Dune: Part Two-make substantial changes to Chani's character in the name of making her more independent, which end up making her more stereotypically masculine. She is mainly a fighter who has a fling with Paul. She is not a mother and not a religious figure, instead rejecting any association with religious beliefs or practices. She is almost a second Jamis except that she has a brief romantic entanglement with Paul.Chani's disavowal of the religious elements in her culture arguably represents a contemporary, Western, cynical view taking over the story; that religion must be purged to empower the individual, to free women from their shackles. This change in Chani's character appears to be intended to make her more free and complex, because she's not a follower and she doesn't believe. She can be dismissive of Paul and sees little to learn from him. Their relationship is then not a mutual exchange, a partnership, but something she has to turn aside from to be independent.The underlying message is that if Chani were a woman of faith like in the book, she couldn't be an interesting, complex character, just a follower who's oppressed. The takeaway is that the Fremen's religious system is bad because it was influenced by outsiders. That faith makes people weak and that being a fighter and killer is preferable to being like the women who live in the sietches, wear headscarves, and discuss religious ideas, or who carry the tribe's ancestors in their bodies.Chani may also reflect a deeper fear in the increasingly secular West about the power of religion in the 21st century. It is possible that the idea in Dune of an oppressed group militarily united under a religious banner, drawing strength from a belief in something greater than themselves, is still too much to put on screen in an adaptation, especially given the book's Middle Eastern influences. If viewers need to be reassured that not everyone believes, that there is division, that someone is the rational one to turn away from the 'fundamentalists,' then Chani offers this. She is the contrasting perspective, the voice of so-called reason, who questions the religious indoctrination.But ultimately, the considerable changes made to Chani's character for Denis Villeneuve's film adaptations alienate her from her lover and her culture and strip her of the many roles she has in the book. Any complexity gained by her skepticism is offset by the loss of her influence and authority and her place in her community. Chani's depiction in the films worryingly suggests that the price of being an independent woman means being faithless and alone.\"", "rating": 8, "sentiment": 1, "date": "11 March 2024", "name": "Tobi-wan-kinobi"}

Dave Bautista's character was, unfortunately, a huge letdown. He is such a good actor that I feel he deserves more of a spotlight. Lastly, I want to mention just how insane this man, Denis Villeneuve, is. I have seen almost all of his films, and I just don't understand how someone can make one huge masterpiece of a blockbuster after another. Blade Runner 2049 is such a perfect film with the perfect serious tone and action set pieces, and the funny thing is that I may as well have been describing Dune Part Two with those words. Just incredible, I look forward to a rewatch when I might give this film the perfect score.\n                \n                    2 out of 4 found this helpful.\n                        \n                            Was this review helpful?

The Dune saga of books written by Frank Herbert beginning in 1963 has captivated and intrigued people for decades. The stories are strange yet very familiar, filled themes within themes, they describe a world much like our own. Filled with alot of narrative thought many have been tried to bring their vision of Dune World to film and TV. Some are good, some are just ok. In my opinion, even with some of the story adaptation done by Villeneuve, he nailed it especially in this second film. It's been years since I've seen anything like this. Reminiscent of Peter Jackson's epic vision of Lord of the Rings, Villeneuve brings Dune to life. Now is it perfect? Can any art be perfect? I find some aspects here and there that are lacking slightly but for me honestly are not worth nitpicking over. I'm guessing there will be some Herbert purists who probably won't like some of the story changes. They are entitled to their opinions of course. For me it was beautiful sci fi. I especially enjoyed the focus on Chani in relation to Paul's changes as he becomes the kwisatz haderach. She's not just a subservient concubine and an extra character but a strong lead.

{"id": 517, "title": "Some startling Choices didn't pay off for me", "content": "Let me start by saying I think this is an excellent film but I'm as conflicted as I am impressed.Rather than being the second half of the book adaptation of Dune - this brings in more of the ideological analysis and political power play that exist across the galaxy. The bulk of this might've been influenced by \"Dune Messiah\" but the roles are impacted, changed, squandered, enhanced and fleshed out.For a long film, less book plot transpires from Dune. The film is asking for a part 3, but may have lost a good portion of its fan base with just how far DV has departed or abandoned aspects of the books.No longer are we given a visual or narrated insight into Paul's insight and visions of the past, present and future.His sister remains unborn add therefore her character is developed as a sentient foetus, the victory of taking back Arrakis is swift despite easily taking the entire runtime of the whole of David Lynch's film and giving us more of a sense of her power and precociousness. Her life as as the Dukes daughter and something more is denied in this representation and Chani is transformed to the opposite of her character in the book. For me this choice to \"empower\" Chani's stance to one of understanding beyond her books character means we lost seeing her wisdom and belief. With the time dedicated, her relationship with Paul is left estranged rather than a deep believer. There was time to develop other characters to portray this revisionism and it is largely borrow from the second novel, Dune Messiah. Exploring how the Bene Gesserates seed prophetic stories and female children to manipulate and control the Houses and the reach of their power over 90 generations and more. No montage and voice over used or needed but the passage of time felt long enough to introduce and develop Paul's sister - she is missed most in the last act. While Chani becomes the voice of decent, Josh Brolin as Gurney becomes sycophantic almost.The choices fit our current world tensions somewhat but DV withholds enough of the book to justify a third film. Too much in my opinion to make this a satisfying film.None book readers/listeners and fans will feel short changed from two films of this running time. There was easily more to develop and conclude AND allow for multiple more films. This feels more like a bargaining tool with WB for a franchise.If the internal voice was silenced from Paul it also distances him from the audience. He is less noble and more vengeful. And the final act seems hurried. With critical fights less impressive and certain kills given to the protagonist.So I am finding this a mixed bag with David Lynch giving more accuracy and conclusion of the book's narrative. However, in Hollywood money is made in retention and sequels. DV now has a divergent version of Dune to bring around. The book spawned several official sequels and this could be the money maker that saves WB.The visuals and large scale action is original and bold. Glorious acting by all save Emperor Walken. No gravitas or strategic brilliance on display. I found this weak casting. Austin Butler surprised me.I felt that the Harkonnen perverse natures was underplayed. Partly because since the book was written, homosexuality is not the non-acceptable sensibility it was in Frank Herbert's time. Also I feel that Hollywood wants money to roll in from countries where representation of such meets censorship.The cinematography and the restraint shown with the Worms really pay off. If I had not read the books, I think this would be up there as a 9/10 that I gave the more promising and faithful part one. So if part 3 now happens and works better for these choices as the plot and character arcs continue then this might deserve more praise.As it stands this may have undermined the book fanbase but gained modern audience satisfaction. Could Chani be a willing and understanding concubine knowing she would be his true love but accept a political marriage in this day and age?It certainly leaves lots to be discussed and hopefully more to be seen. I truly hope this is successful and I understand the posture. I can't help but feel two films was sufficient for Dune. Frank Herbert, it could be argued had to write Messiah to capitalise on his own success and to bridge and retrofit Dune to enable Children of Dune. This way perhaps DV has positioned himself more strategically. Does he have the stamina for the journey to continue? I hope the answer is a YES from Legendary and WB.", "rating": 7, "sentiment": 1, "date": "6 March 2024", "name": "novakid-72908"}

It's an absolute cinematic masterpiece! A film that stuns you with its cinematography, gives you goosebumps with its music and leaves you in awe with its performances.Denis Villeneuve's filmography and how it gets better with every film is simply remarkable, and probably he's got the best one yet with Dune Part Two. His sense of direction and his vision for the film and franchise is beyond anything and it shows... you can see the grandiosity, and yet the stillness in so many of the scenes.The story (for those who aren't aware) keeps getting bigger as it progresses, and the film keeps levelling up! The silence is golden because then the shots can speak more than the dialogue. There are also scenes which amp you up like nothing else.Alongside that ride, is Grieg Fraser with the best cinematography you can see on the big screen, especially the IMAX screen. Every frame is a treat to watch, the details, the scenes, everything. There's no small or big scene here, everything is a cinematic experience, the still scenes and the magnanimous moments.Timothee Chalamet is showcasing his best work here and we aren't talking about it enough already... There's a stillness, and stoicism in his performance, but also ferocity and hunger, the combination of elements that bring out the best of him on the screen and elevate his performance.While Zendaya's role seemed more of a supporting one, rather than a lead one, it is an important role where much of her performance is through her eyes more than anything else... and there's so much power in that.You cannot talk about Dune Part Two and not talk about Rebecca Ferguson, her command over her character and the power-packed performance she has delivered, you're in awe every time she's on screen.Javier Bardem, Florence Pugh, Christopher Walken, and Josh Brolin are all exceptional... but there's another standout name that yet again delivers brilliantly, Austin Butler. What a scene-stealer! His voice, his look, his personality, a fiery role in this already exceptional cast.The impact Dune Part Two makes is incomplete without the music of Hans Zimmer. Literal goosebumps are what you're able to feel, the elevation that it brings to the scenes and how you're able to feel what's about to come only with the music is extraordinary.There are some films when you say, \"This is Cinema\"... and this is one of them.

Building upon the foundation laid by its predecessor, this installment delves deeper into the complexities of power, prophecy, and the perilous nature of heroism.The narrative resumes just after the fall of House Atreides on Arrakis, orchestrated by the secret machinations of Emperor Shaddam IV and House Harkonnen. Despite the devastation, Paul Atreides and his mother Jessica manage to escape, finding refuge among the native Fremen. The Fremen, believing in the prophecy of a savior known as Lisan Al Gaib, come to see Paul as their potential messiah. However, as Paul seeks to rally the Fremen for revenge against the Emperor and House Harkonnen, questions arise about his true nature and destiny.Director Denis Villeneuve's masterful execution elevates every aspect of the film, from the breathtaking visuals to the nuanced performances. Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet's portrayal of Paul Atreides is a mesmerizing blend of vulnerability and authority, while Zendaya's Chani serves as a poignant anchor amidst the turmoil. The chemistry between them adds depth to their star-crossed romance, enriching the emotional beats of the story.The supporting cast delivers standout performances, with Javier Bardem's Stillgar providing moments of levity amid the tension. Bardem's portrayal infuses the character with a blend of wisdom and humor. Austin Butler's Feyd-Rautha Harkonnen emerges as a chilling antagonist, his off-the-rails psychosis portrayed with chilling authenticity. The hand-to-hand combat scene between Rautha and Paul, though brief, is a testament to Butler's prowess as an actor and the film's meticulous choreography. Also Rebecca Fergusion as Jessica, Stellan Skarsgard as Vladimir Harkonnen and Batista as Rabban Harkonnen deliver incredible performances.The film's exploration of religious fundamentalism adds another layer of complexity to its narrative. As Stillgar fervently believes in Paul's divine role as the savior, and the Bene Gesserit manipulate prophecies to serve their own agenda, the dangers of blind faith and fanaticism are laid bare. Villeneuve's deft handling of these themes adds depth and urgency to the story, inviting viewers to reflect on the nature of belief and its consequences.Greg Fraser's cinematography deserves special mention for its stunning visuals, which capture the vast and treacherous landscapes of Arrakis with breathtaking beauty. Moments like Paul's first ride atop a majestic Shai Hulud are a sight to behold, showcasing Fraser's mastery in bringing the world of Dune to life on the screen.Dune is incomplete without its music, scored masterfully by Hans Zimmer. He has given uncountable iconic themes in the past and yet he manages to score another gem which will surely become the new benchmark for such out-wordly adventure movies.\"Dune: Part 2\" is not merely a spectacle; it is a dark and dense story that demands the viewer's full attention. To fully appreciate this movie, viewers must watch Part 1 and pay close attention to every word spoken on screen. This is not a film to be taken lightly; it is an immersive experience that rewards careful observation and reflection.One of the most goosebumps-inducing moments comes when Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet's Paul Muad'dib Usul Atreides uses the Voice with chilling authority, screaming 'Silence' to a character. It's a testament to Chalamet's commanding presence.Christopher Nolan must count his lucky stars that \"Dune: Part 2\" faced delays, allowing his film \"Oppenheimer\" to shine during the awards season. Villeneuve's masterpiece would have undoubtedly overshadowed many contenders with its unparalleled grandeur and depth, solidifying Villenueve's status as a true sci-fi genius.Dune Part 2 is Monumental, Malevolent and Captivating, a true sci-fi movie of a Generation. \"Long live the Fighters\".Cannot recommend highly enough to be watched on an IMAX screen.", "rating": 10, "sentiment": 1, "date": "9 March 2024", "name": "kaustubh-goswami23"}

To this end, Part Two benefits from the foundations laid by Part One. The factions are set, motivations clear and the movie is a direct consequence of everything that occurred in Part One, if not thousands of years before. That being said, this film isn't lazy when it comes to building the world deeper. Past characters evolve, new characters appear, motivations become clearer and we get a deeper understanding of how the world works including the different people, religions and weapons. I cared for the characters in a way that I didn't in the first film. Chalamet, Zendaya and the ensembled cast all have their moments to shine but that is another discussion.However the story is only half of what made this one of the best IMAX experiences. The action set pieces and fight scenes were so well done. The visual are amazing, everything on screen looks real. It's as if somebody filmed a real life place. Set design, cinematography, costumes are all off the charts. It will sweep up a tonne of the technical awards at the 2025 Oscars. If you thought the Sandworm set piece in Part One was good, Part Two takes it no another level.And despite all of that, the best part of the film might be the sound design. It was relentless and it enhances every second of the film. I don't recall a better sounded film. The desert, vehicles, weapons... Every second you hear something going on and it keeps the world alive.It was a lot to pack into 2 hours and 46 minutes and certain parts move quicker than you would like, for example the third act, whilst others might feel some of the moments outside of the action scenes a little slower.

Her role in Part II is severely truncated, although she gives away much of what will happen in Dune Messiah and Children of Dune, not that most film-goers will catch it.I know this sounds ridiculous, but this film just seems too short to tell the long journey of teenage Paul to the adult antihero Muad'dib who coldly murders Baron Harkonnen and rips the throne from the Emperor.But even though I feel this way, what Villaneuve gives us is richly satisfying as a pair of heroic, action-packed, hard science fiction films very much in the spirit of Frank Herbert.", "rating": 9, "sentiment": 1, "date": "5 March 2024", "name": "klotzilla-1"}

The imagery created in this movie was beyond anything I had ever imagined while reading the book. The visual storytelling and world building beautifully condenses so much of Herbert's writing to focus on romance, revenge, betrayal, fundamentalism and transcendence. It is a different ride than part one. I won't provide any spoilers, but here are a few other random thoughts.I got a kick out of the brief but genuinely appreciative intro recorded for the special IMAX showing. I hope they start doing more of these. Hopefully it will get movie fans back in packed theaters because Dune: Part Two is an experience in IMAX that made the story better that I can't get at home. I love watching movies at home with subtitles, but I would have missed a lot visually if I focused on reading those.I left the theater somewhat overwhelmed by not just the IMAX technology and pace of storytelling, but also the parallels with current events of religious fundamentalism rebelling against corrupt, evil powers focused on maximizing wealth. The fact the movie packed in that much in under three hours was an achievement.

Because it is well done, it is entertaining, it doesn't have a dull moment.But.I watched it twice and every time i leave, i feel sad.

It had too much of everything and too little time to tell the story in the right way and to develop characters. I felt like i was in a sprint, hurrying up to see the end.Second - there was not enough music. In first part music was everything! Music was telling the story, causing feelings. Here i just miss it too much.Third - i just have to point out again the lack of character development. Characters are introduced too fast and disappear even faster. But this is also why i think this movie should be 2 movies instead of one.And i just have to say Austin Butler was the worst. He became annoying in the real life too. He is so full of himself it's painful to watch. And Zendaya is bland. Also there is zero chemistry between her and Timothee.Timothee was finally good, but they didn't give him time to shine as much as he can and he can shine a lot. But he was really good.Overall, movie was very good, and i am happy to live in a time where i had opportunity to see LOTR, Hobbit and Dune, but Dune 2 has its own flaws, and you can feel them.

{"id": 568, "title": "Close to perfection, but we need Part Three", "content": "First, a few words on the IMAX presentation I saw in Geneva, Switzerland (Balexert cin\u00e9mas). Certainly spectacular, but the Dolby Atmos presentation is pretty earth shattering -- and ear shattering -- in the action sequences. Wear concert earplugs or be prepared to cover your ears for part of the film since permanent hearing damage is a risk if volume levels are like those in the presentation I saw.As for the film. Bottom line. The day after watching Dune Part Two, I wanted to watch it again. I recently re-watched Dune Part One on my home system (55 inch OLED TV and Dolby Atmos soundbar). I picked up significant character and plot detail that I'd missed on my initial viewing. I expect I will have the same experience with Dune Part Two. There is a lot in this film -- but even at 2 hours, 45 minutes a few things that were missing.The visuals are amazing. No CGI artifacts I could see -- in contrast to an IMAX 'Kong v. Godzilla' trailer that ran just before the film. Incredible world-building, as in Part One. Everything appears very natural, even when the settings are strange, other-worldly.This is a film without a dull moment. Every scene is critical to the story's forward movement. That movement is relentless. For me, that was a problem. Not everything was explained to my satisfaction. These weren't exactly plot holes, but rather plot ellipses.I hope Villeneuve produces a longer -- at least 3h -- director's cut that gives the film a bit more room to breathe and the characters a bit more depth.Still, the actors inhabit their characters completely. The story is riveting. There is plenty of dramatic tension -- even though you know how the film will end if you are even vaguely familiar with the source material.Villeneuve hasn't produced his masterpiece ... yet. I'm looking for a bit more depth and complexity. I understand that Dune Messiah -- which hasn't yet been approved by Warner, but which looks a certainty -- will provide that. Villeneuve, his actors and audience will get a chance to really unpack and dismantle the messiah myth. In any case, in Dune, parts one and two, Villeneuve and cast have planted the seeds for what could be sci-fi's top film trilogy of all time.", "rating": 9, "sentiment": 1, "date": "10 March 2024", "name": "gsm404"}

{"id": 570, "title": "Very, very good", "content": "This movie really does take what Dune Part One does great, and do it just as well and in some cases better. The acting is superb, the visuals and cinematography are amazing, the music/lack thereof enhances scenes. I absolutely love the costumes. There is so much to like. I've never read the books, I haven't seen the 1980's movie, I even only recently saw Part One. Going in blind still has blown me away. Some movies really struggle to immerse you and make you feel like a fictional world could be real, this movie is not one.Timothee really steals the show for me once he comes back to life. He really seemed untouchable and has a commanding presence. The duel between him and Na-Baron was intense, and I loved how there wasn't any music for that fight. The worm riding scene was so cool too.. heck, I thought Chani showing Paul how to properly sand walk was great (the shot with the close up of her feet).The only knocks I have against this movie are when Paul is supposed to survive in the desert alone, then shortly meets Chani. Then suddenly they're out with a bunch of Fremen taking on a spice harvester? It seemed as though they rushed Paul and Chani's relationship a bit. Also, when Paul doesn't want to go south, but then decides to. He ends up drinking the life water. Did he need to do that? I'm not sure if that was explained, or if I missed it. Some of the Harkenen scenes with the coliseum as well as the shots of the army didn't have the greatest special effects to me, but that might've been intentional.Overall, the few problems I had with the movie really aren't that big of a deal. I saw it in IMAX which was a good idea! I'm looking forward to being able to see this again. To me, this is more of a 9.5/10. Might end up changing it to a 10 after another viewing, we will see.

Somehow Paul runs at a soldier in the beginning leaving his mom behind, then to his left another soldier is coming at him only to be hit on the head from behind...hey must be Chani...no it's his mom...how did she get there so fast and unseen?Then Paul has to prove himself by going into the desert, is given a tent etc and told to go. Next scene he's with Chani..ok np...then the next scene his trial is apparently over and he's there and back already...what?Then he's walking up a hill towards his worm calling, the fremen are seated behind him watching him walk up the hill. Then they are apparently now staring at a field and Paul is over to their right? Huh? He calls a worm and it breaks through the hill that he was standing on continuing to the right, seemingly out of eye to the fremen since the hill was blocking there view of the right...yet somehow they appear to see him riding this worm and cheer.Then they attack a spice harvester, hidden under the sand, seemingly able to hide their digging, footprints but hey ok. Then they attack just as they are able to get run over, an ornicopter takes out seemingly 1/2 of them, then Paul and Chani decide to attack it, while some others go to confront other soldiers. The ornicopter stays on Paul/Chani and can't seem to just move around so it can see under the legs and lets itself be blown up, all ground combat seemingly done with swords/knives for some reason. Next attack on a harvester is completed with only a single laser weapon....why have 1/2 the men killed in the first raid if you had that!So many more scenes that just abruptly happen or people teleporting around for no logical reason. Paul comes into the temple to take the water of life, \"You shouldn't be here\", \"I'm here to take the water of life\", teleport to him with different clothes, \"here you go\". Pretty sure when he takes it he had other people with him and it wasn't done so damn quickly.Alia being a fetus throughout the entire movie made zero sense given they showed what appeared to be her quickened growth in the beginning after the water of life was taken, months and months go by in the desert(Chani telling Paul it's been a long time since he's had his nightmares implies their relationship has been going on a long time) yet Jessica never appears to show further than maybe 6-7 months along...Alia never being born and not killing the Baron. Why??I give this a 6 because despite all these terrible edits/choices the movie is still striking visually, and the costume design was fantastic, but wow...just wow to the above.", "rating": 6, "sentiment": 1, "date": "3 March 2024", "name": "sonickrunch"}

The action was always incredible, like when they attacked the spice mining thing, but especially in this part wow. Everything was done perfectly. I definitely didn't like that Paul became a villain but it's still great. Like yeah he sucks now but it's still cool to see. This world is absolutely fascinating, with all the rituals done by the Fremen and all the talk of other worlds and stuff. The Harkonan planet looked amazing, they did that part really well and the editing was fantastic. Probably the thing I wanted to see more of the most was them traveling across the world. As it is they just kinda teleported, I know they rode on sandworms but I wanted to see more, especially when they went through the storm. That part felt like they glossed over it, as well as them mounting and dismounting the worms. I know how they mount but genuinely, how do they get off? Especially with tents on them! How did the tents get on? How did they get off? How did the less experienced people get on? I know the Fremen have been doing this all their lives, but still how do you get a bunch of inexperienced people on a sandworm, WITH TENTS! It's like trying to jump on a freight train and pitch a tent on it while sand is flying everywhere like HOW!! I can't say that's a problem, just something I was really confused by. Anyway seeing Paul's sister was also really cool, can't wait to see more of her.

But Part 1 was just a juicy appetiser to what is an extraordinary Part 2. This film is one of the best of the decade and maybe even of the century.To start with the obvious, the visuals, music and sound are top notch. This film is why people go to cinemas. The CG is flawless and at no point was my immersion broken. Hans Zimmer masterfully builds on his score from Part 1 with some truly great stuff. The cinematography is gorgeous and shows off Greg Fraiser's immense talent.The ensemble cast are all excellent, no bad performances are to be seen. Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet excels as Paul Atreides and he is excellent at playing the naive boy turned ruthless war general. Zendaya brings extra dimensions to Chani that arguably exceed the book version. In fact, The Fremen in general are more developed and diverse than in the book. Everyone gives it their all but the absolute standout is Austin Butler as Feyd-Rautha. He is unrecognisable but does such an excellent job at giving the character great presence and charisma.There are deviations from the book, but they're all done well and are all done in service of a stronger, more streamlined and more digestible film overall. What's important is that the core themes of the book are perfectly intact within this film. The ideas are explored expertly and every moment feels well built and earned. While there are moments that may seem rushed, the book spends the exact same amount of time on them. Besides, the time is used well to develop characters.Overall, Dune Part 2 is nothing short of a masterpiece. It's everything a fan of the franchise could want.

But Villeneuve and his crew absolutely pulled it off again with this mesmerising masterpiece that pulled me down to the surface of Arrakis and pushed me through a religious revolution without ever letting go.That's not to deny its flaws. It's probably a bit too long. Some characters are turned into a caricature of themselves. Some deviations from the book were clearly done for brevity, but others are serious deviations that will surely have major ramifications as the story continues. It hits a little too hard on the nose with its core message that religion is a great power but morally ambiguous.All of that is nit-picking however. The film manages to combine multiple plot lines, character development and world building without sacrificing pace or relying on fight scenes to keep the momentum going. It's true to the broad strokes (and some of the smaller ones) of Frank Herbert's vision, but perfectly accessible to someone who only saw part one years ago. Every piece of the film making craft comes together in this beautiful sci-fi epic.

Everyone is raving about the effects, to be honest I found the sandworms to be not so impressive. Ornithopters and spice mining equipment were awesome. Chani's role, for which Zendaya is a perfect fit, is inflated to the detriment of the overall experience. The end of the movie was really quite disappointing, with Chani making a scene (again), but also in particular that Alia didn't materialise. And the plot to kill Paul with a hidden blade didn't come out either. Christopher Walken is not a good cast for the emperor, which is really sad, as it is such an important role. The Sardaukar were not at all fearsome. Irulan though, in her blandness, was perfect. It would have been nice to emphasise the importance of the spice more, and what all the fuzz around Arrakis is actually about. The cruelty of the Harkonnens is conveyed convincingly, but Feyd is a weak character. Mentats and Guild are missing which is sad. But the focus on the ensuing jihad in the end is a nice touch.

It has neither a plot twist like Empire and the good guys don't lose, instead they win pretty easily. So if you compare these two movies with another the only comman ground you will find is that both are the secon parts of their trilogies and that they are both sci-fi movies. That's the end of the tale.So let's talk about the movie. I liked Dune Part aone because of the visuals and the soundtrack. The story was solid and entertaining but it didn't hook me that much. Also the characters are a bit too flat. If you look at the IMDb rating (8.0) you see that the general audience liked it but it is no masterpiece.So my expectations for the second part were not that high and so they got surpassed, because this time the story got me. It just happened more and it felt like more action than in the first part. The visuals got even better, just take the black and white parts and Hans Zimmer's score is amazing again. The battle in the end was also satisfying and so this movie turns out be a pretty outstanding one.And this is the time I have to return to my opening part, because unfortunately some people of our generation z have to make some stupid statements they know nothing about.

{"id": 596, "title": "Materpiece is an understatement. LB: danva0307", "content": "LONG LIVE THE FIGHTERS!This film being a masterpiece is simply an understatement. It's practically perfect. I genuinely have not a single critique that I can think of. This is the best experience with a film I probably have ever had.I'm going to split this up into two parts, the first without spoilers and the second half will contain some pretty big spoilers that I need to address.Spoiler Free:Where do I even begin... from the very beginning scene you can tell this is going to be phenomenal. If you liked Dune 2021 at least a faint bit you will most likely love this. Everything from the first film is elevated tenfold. You can feel the amount of pure passion and love that Denis Villeneuve and the entire crew poured onto this behemoth of a project. Easily another Oscar sweep for Dune, this time it'll most likely win Best Picture because I can't fathom another film getting this close to perfection ever again or at least in the near future. Visually unexplainably beautiful. If you get the chance you need to watch it in IMAX or just the largest screen and loudest speakers you possibly can. The black and white Feyd-Rautha sequence is edited to unfathomable levels of perfection, hell that's just one of the scenes I can say that for. This movie has at least ten of the most bad-ass shots I've ever seen. Hans Zimmer's score is crafted with his usual mastery and is complimented so greatly by Greig Fraser's visuals in a beautiful tango of sight and sound.The conflicts our characters face are so intriguing and immersive, that we understand what they're going through, the dire decisions they have to make, and what it will cost them. The commentary on faith, purpose, and what is too far? It's so much more than a pretty sci-film movie with cool sounds, there is so much soul and so much to say and it executes every beat it wants to hit without fail. From giant epic battles to deep, personal, emotional, and quiet conversations it all blends as one beautiful portrait that is easily Denis Viellenueves Magnum Opus.The entire cast bodies every roll. Timothee Chalamet is the perfect Paul Atreides he handles his character with such power and gives off this Aura that I haven't seen in a very long time, may be the best character ever written that I've seen. If you don't care about this film at all that's okay, but please watch it to see his performance at least. Austin Butler's Feyd-Rautha is even more menacing than he is in the books and, again, is transformed into a performance I could see getting him another Oscar Nomination. Rebecca Ferguson's Lady Jessica has this presence that I can't even put into words. Zendaya's Chani has this beautiful chemistry with Chalamet's Paul Atreides with an irreplicable story between them so greatly displayed.I LOVED the costume design accompanied by some spectacular lighting that compliments each other in a way I haven't seen anything close to it.This is absolute Sci-Fi perfection. This is tied or even surpasses Empire as the best Sci-Fi film of all time and is the easiest top four I have ever put on this account, and it won't leave that's for sure. Every person who worked on this is a master at their craft and will be remembered throughout history as the people who put together potentially the greatest story ever told. I heard all the praise that this film got and knew after reading the book that it was going to be easily one of my favorites, but nothing could have prepared me for it to be as good as it was. Genuinely cannot think of a complaint. I commented on the first Dune how I wish there was an extended edition, not needed anymore. Denis Villeneuve couldn't have done better. He elevated the emotion and intensity of everything that happens in the novel with numerous additions to the source material while still being perfectly faithful. The only thing that saddens me is that Frank Herbert himself couldn't have watched this, I just know this is exactly what he wanted and what he deserved for his masterpiece of a novel.I can't express what this movie means to me, I'll be rewatching it over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over again. I've thrown around the phrase \"This is my Empire Strikes Back\" a few times like when I watched Endgame for example, but this is truly the only film that is deserving of that phrase. I'm so thankful I had the opportunity to see it all unfold in IMAX with a packed theater of pure Dune fans. It felt like home.LONG LIVE CINEMA.SPOILERS:\n..\n..\nTHEY GAVE GURNEY HIS BALISET!!!!! I genuinely got so excited that he got his few seconds with it. Denis' adaptation is so faithful to the source material while still having some insane creative liberties that for the first time (outside of his first Dune) just increases the quality.I LOVED what he did with Princess Irulan where we got to see her actually record the excerpts we read at the beginning of every chapter, such a great detail that lets us dive deeper into her character that barely makes an appearance in the actual book. Actually, Denis Villeneuve does a wonderful job of extending the appearances of all these characters that weren't in the novel in the first place. We get so much Rabban which makes me so happy, I was wishing we had gotten more of him in the first film because he's a pretty important character who we don't see much action from already in the book. So us being able to see him at his fullest during this was great. I can't even begin to talk about Feyd-Rautha... what a character, his presence is only matched by Muad'dib himself (who I will get to shortly). He's so menacing and evil... I love him. Getting to see him just slash people for simply questioning him was awesome and I'm so glad we got to see even more parallels between him and Muad'dib especially the added Gom Jabbar that I don't recall being a part of the novel, hell 90% of his scenes weren't in the novel but are all so in character and perfectly done that it's as if it was all a part of the original writing.Paul Atreides, Muad'dib, Usul, Kwisatz Harderach, Lisanal whatever you want to call him is easily one of the best characters ever put onto screen. I've said it already a few times, but the AURA that Chalamet brings to this character is something I can't put into words and is something that needs to be experienced. The shift in his character as we see him slowly accept his terrible purpose is so brilliantly displayed. The expressions in his eyes, the way he presents himself, all of it changes ever so slightly as we see him being The One. I remember after reading the book I revisited Dune 2021 and was lost on why they left out the revelation that the Baron is Lady Jessica's Father/ Paul's Grandfather. I remember thinking that this movie was gonna be half flashbacks because of scenarios like that and was slightly worried. I will never put an ounce of doubt on Villeneuve ever again. The way that it's revealed is so well done that it was another one of those moments where you'd think that it was written like that originally. Paul's conflict is so well displayed I loved seeing the really dark undertones that he was showing as the film progressed realizing that this war is a necessary thing to happen and no matter what that throne has to be taken. It's exactly what Frank Herbert would have wanted after he had to make an entire second book just because everyone thought Paul was a perfect hero, Denis handled that misconception perfectly and I can't wait for Dune Messiah (God please let it be greenlit) to see him fully handle the aftermath. That means I'm going to be reading Dune Messiah ASAP.I thought the choice of Alia not being born and no real mention of Leto II was very interesting but definitely didn't take anything away from the film. It definitely would be weird and difficult to have a four-year-old act like an all-knowing Bene Gesserit woman. I love how it also allowed for the chance of Paul killing the Baron himself which in my opinion was much more satisfying than Alia doing it. Speaking of satisfying death I loved how Gurney was the one who was able to kill Rabban after he mentioned that he killed his family as well as gave him the scar on his face much much more satisfying. Lady Jessica talking to Alia with her still in the womb I thought was really cool and perfectly displayed the connection the Bene Gesserit have with each other as well as a cool nod to the mother-daughter bond.Every battle (especially the final one) has so much raw emotion and strength with this scale that cannot be matched. I was grinning from ear to ear so much that I wish I had a camera set on me throughout the whole thing. The Atreides banner being waved on top of sandworms is one of the coolest things I'll ever see. The Feyd-Rautha birthday gladiator fight is one of the coolest things I'll ever see. The final battle between Muad'dib and Feyd-Rautha is one of the coolest things I'll ever see. The world-building as we dive further into Arrakis and Giedi Prime is one of the coolest things I'll ever see. The conflicts between Bene Gesserit, Fremen, Atreides, Harkonnen, Sardaukar, and Guild, is one of the coolest things I'll ever see.I could type for years, but I need to just let this soak for a bit, I'll be writing more with every watch of this I have.", "rating": 10, "sentiment": 1, "date": "28 February 2024", "name": "danva-68271"}

Following Paul's house being destroyed and being forced to take cover with the Fremen, it follows Paul's insertion and ascension to the Prophet mentioned and how he engrains himself into the Fremen culture and move pieces across the galaxy board.Story wise, impeccable. Every scene adds something enriching from connecting characters to progressing themes or plots or adding or introducing characters. Dennis nailed and refined the script to make every scene captivating. It also includes some of the best sci-fi visuals I've ever seen, the home world of the Harkonens with the black sun leading to the rest of the people having white skin was incredible awe-inspiring. Paul's personal growth was incredible, from becoming a Fremen via various tasks like riding a sand worm to the immediate switch when he drank the Water of Life switching the pacing to another height entirely. Incredible growth from major characters especially Paul's mother and Chani besides Paul whilst also expanding among other large characters in the Dune universe such as the Emporer and the Na-Baron Feyd, the Baron's nephew.Acting, A+ from literally everyone across the board. Not one lacking, everyone brought their utmost to every role, no matter how minor and it's incredible to see considering how many big actors are in the roles.The cinematography and visuals were on another level this movie, I would highly recommend IMAX, anything else would reduce the movie's quality. The cinematographer did their best work ever with many of the shots and scenes becoming iconic already; concise and clear, never wobbly with the greatest visuals imagery in any sci-fi movie.Sound design also impeccable, honestly this may be considered the best aspect from the movie perspective. Every boom, bass, just completely gripped you into the world, helps it stand out and be remembered long after the movie has ended.TL;DR: best in literally aspect a movie could be, worth many rewatches and in IMAX. A mighty achievement of a sci-fi movie and just any movie generally and will become an all-time classic.

I really, really wanted it to bring the story together and blow my mind.Well, it didn't. It's more like Dune: Part One than I expected. And not in a good way.Let's start with pacing. It's slow. Oh my word is it slow. The first 90 minutes are taken up with quasi-religious disagreements among the Fremen about whether the prophecy of a saviour is true or not. Most of this is in a non-English dialect so be prepared to read a lot of subtitles. Villeneuve can film an underground stone temple and scores of hooded followers like no-one else - but don't fool yourself that this is good material.After a long wait, we are finally introduced to some of the new characters that are going to bring this chapter to its conclusion. A common theme is that the big names that came on for the second half are barely used. Austin Butler's portrayal of the unhinged Feyd Rautha is great. He is introduced in a striking visual setpiece. But I wanted more of him. Christopher Walken is well cast as the Emperor but it is a small role. Florence Pugh has very little to work with, and two-thirds of her scenes are essentially narration. Lea Seydoux must have shot her scenes in a day. Anya Taylor-Joy probably shot her scene in an hour after visiting Denis at his beach house a couple of weeks before the premiere.The cast really misses the humanity of Oscar Isaac and Jason Momoa. There is far too much Timothee and Zendaya - and to be honest, they aren't strong enough actors to carry a film of this scale. Villeneuve spends most of his time doing slow and meaningful zooms into their lovely faces as they stand on windswept sand dunes.Now in its defence I will say that a handful of the \"action\" scenes in the film are striking, in particular, an early Fremen attack on a spice harvester, Feyd Rautha's debut in the colosseum, and Paul Atreides' final contest in front of his rivals. Nobody can create a cinematic feast quite like Denis - it looks and sounds fantastic. But the large scale battles are disappointing, starting and ending suddenly, and with a level of destructive power that makes you wonder why the rebellion hadn't happened sooner.I watched Dune: Part One at home the day before watching Part Two. One was a disappointment. Two is, unexpectedly, an even greater one.PS I think this had a rough ride in the edit suite. Keep an eye out for strange continuity and sound anomalies in the last hour.

It's better than the first film and carries on Villeneuve's undeniable knack for phenomenal visuals and sound design, but the substance of the story itself was about as boring as you'd imagine a featureless desert planet to be. Not to mention it's weirdly orientalist.Many scenes have abstract and overbaked cinematography that borders on downright self-indulgence. Despite a few epic highlights and eye-catching shots, the story itself boils down to several fights and explosions that amount to an upmarket Michael Bay flick. Premonitions of divinity and tedious ceremonial rites hog swathes of the runtime as we're ushered into forced reverence of an unremarkable Paul Atreides (Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet). It feels like an intentional plot-building film, an interlude-steppingstone, which is not a good thing because it's relying on your interest in a future film (Messiah), not this one.Unlike Sci-Fi greats, George Lucas's Star Wars Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back comes to mind, this film nearly entirely lacks a complex ensemble of vibrant and interesting characters with engaging interplay, repartees, and intelligent dialogue. Lucas took some inspiration from Frank Herbert and (most importantly) formatted the genre for the big screen; making a watchable, likeable and memorable Sci-Fi epic that is now beloved by millions, with a lore that has incredibly rare profundity; even spawning a religion (Jediism). Dune's lore *is* interesting too, it's just poorly represented here.This film is humourless and flat. The characters had very few interesting things to say. Entertainment was thrown out in exchange for drearily over-serious solemnity. When many costumes are point-blank laughable, I cannot take the film unironically seriously. Various themes are often too obviously borrowed from elsewhere; Harkonnens from the Soviets (the Baron is called \"Vladimir\"), or the Fremen from Muslim North Africans resisting a colonial force.

{"id": 616, "title": "This is what movies can be", "content": "I haven't been this pleased with a movie in what seems like years. So often nowadays we see big blockbuster films skip the substance and go for spectacle to what seems like just to make a quick buck. Whether it's a new installment to an old franchise that doesn't need to be rebooted or another lazy superhero film, movies today seem almost disrespectful to the art form that I grew up loving so dearly.But this movie gives me hope. Not only does it utilize its big budget to create a one of a kind visual and auditory experience, it is backed up with an incredible story that comes together so perfectly. Visuals are absolutely stunning and it's obvious the makers of the film took their dear time with creating a visual masterpiece throughout the different settings whether it be in Arrakis, Geidi Prime or the emperors home planet. I mean seriously it is one of the most beautiful movies I have ever seen.The use of modern technology I think needs to be replicated in the blockbusters to come. Not an over reliance on CGI for action scenes, but used just enough to create a surreal universe that up until now you could only find in a handful of movies throughout the years.The story obviously is legendary. Frank Herbert's story is almost mythical at this point, but it was adapted to screen so perfectly that when it came time for the emperor to arrive in Arrakis, I literally leaned forward in my chair to watch the climax. The way that the three main groups (Freman, Harkonans and the Emperor) come together in the end of the movie just felt so natural and smooth. There was never a time in which I was questioning why characters were making the choices they were making. It just made sense what was happening, the characters behaved rationally and it happened with style too.The first comparison I made to this movie when I finished watching was Lord of the Rings. A book that series that once felt impossible to adapt, but once the role was taken by someone who truly loved the source material and truly loved film (and had the budget to do so), we were treated with a movie unlike anything I have ever seen. This is what a movie can be, if more directors put their heart into a film and utilize modern technology, they most certainly can create a film like Dune: Part Two. I think we are all sick of seeing the same reboots, sequels and cliche superhero movies over and over again, in fact the trailers prior to the movie had me exhausted considering every single one was unoriginal and appeared like a lazy cash grab trying to capitalize on nostalgia. But, this, this is what we have been missing in film the last few years. A film with the substance of the films of the 60s-90s and the spectacle and use of the capabilities of modern times, we can get visual arts forms that prior to now only came about in a few instances (Insterstellar, LOTR, even Infinity War). I hope this sets a new precedent for blockbuster movies, films that seem to actually care about the viewer and not act as a way to stimulate our brain with jumbled CGI fights and plots with more holes than Swiss cheese (like seriously, who wants another Godzilla and Kong movie? Don't even get me started on the movies Disney puts out every year.) This is the type of movie up until now I could only ever dream of, but we're here, and if this is a telling sign of the future of film, it brings me great hope for the rest of the 2020s.", "rating": 10, "sentiment": 1, "date": "2 March 2024", "name": "kanej-66006"}

If it wasn't already clear with Part One, it is safe to say that Denis Villeneuve has ushered in a new era of mega sci-fi blockbuster filmmaking, that leaves little room to be matched, if only by its inevitable sequel and conclusion to this trilogy, Dune: Messiah.If Dune: Part One was the appetizer, then Dune: Part Two is what can only be described as the main course, as Villeneuve himself has put it. The action is on another level with superbly choreographed fight scenes that is worthy of being at the top of the sci-fi genre. The lore and mythology is expanded upon greatly and what Denis has brought to the screen is truly a cinematic achievement. Following Part One's Best Picture nomination and 6 Academy Award wins, this may very well be a huge contender next year.Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet COMMANDS his presence on screen in an unbelievably powerful performance that leaves you both in awe and unease. His evolution into the Muad'Dib, the \"Messiah\", is a journey of discovery and Timoth\u00e9e portrays the complex nature of it to perfection. The level of intensity and depth is prevalent throughout the film and the journey of him being just a boy next in line for the throne, to the leader of the Fremen is remarkable. This entire cast is an A-list cast, with fantastic after fantastic actors appearing and bringing more dimensions to their character from Part One, along with the new ones played by Austin Butler as the psychotic Feyd-Rautha, Florence Pugh as Princess Irulan, L\u00e9a Seydoux as Lady Margot Fenring and Christopher Walken as The Emperor.

He instantly becomes a character that will be remembered as one of the toughest & fearsome villains in sci-fi history.Hans Zimmer's absolutely INCREDIBLE score soars through the auditorium in a euphoric way and completely mesmerizes you upon what you are witnessing on screen. He engulfs you into the world of Arrakis with the intensity of the drums we've come to love from him and the ethereal romantic love theme of Paul & Chani being instantly memorable. He has done it again and his passion and love for the story, couldn't be more prevalent with his score for the world of Dune and it's intricate characters. The sound mix literally feels like it goes through you in IMAX and right off the bat too as those iconic drum beats start the film. This is a MUST WATCH in IMAX!This film is truly GARGANTUAN all across the board, from the scope, scale, epic war battles, religious context, the moral decisions the characters face & the literal ginormous Sandworms that devour the screen. Filmed for IMAX with the digitally certified cameras (not to confused with 70mm film cameras, albeit there is a 70mm film reel) there is no other way to experience this film (at least on your first viewing) than on the BIGGEST IMAX screen you can get to. Seeing it on a 1.90:1 screen was huge, but I can only imagine what the lucky people who'll see it on a 1.43:1 screen in either IMAX 70mm or dual laser will experience. The fact that there's EVEN MORE image in scenes with up to 40min in 1.43:1 will be such a visual treat. If only Warner Bros & IMAX provided all 30 capable 1.43;1 IMAX theatres like Universal did for Oppenheimer.There are so many scenes & shots that are a cinematic achievement unlike any other. It will need many rewatches to be able to absorb everything displayed, catch certain plot details that may have been missed, but the first viewing is absolutely mind blowing. The scene shown on the IMAX poster with the Sandworms appearing out of the shadows, is truly eye opening and my eyes were already widened in complete awe. The arena scene is essentially Gladiator in space & it is definitely a standout moment. You also really feel like you're there in the arena, when seen on such a large screen. Villeneuve has rocketed through any of the previous bars set before in the genre and it really makes me proud to know that this ingenious filmmaker is Canadian!Without question, Denis Villeneuve has cemented himself as one of the best sci-fi directors of all time with Arrival, Blade Runner 2049, Dune: Part One and now Dune: Part Two being one of the best sequels ever. He has brought everything that he learned from those films into this one and showcased new elements of his craft that solidifies just how much he understands, respects and loves Dune. This film will be a juggernaut and there's no denying that we have yet to see more from the world of Arrakis.\"Long live cinema!\" - Denis Villeneuve.", "rating": 9, "sentiment": 1, "date": "29 February 2024", "name": "rhyderstudios"}
{"id": 620, "title": "Dune: Part Two Review Said Dogan", "content": "Today, I watched \"Dune: Part Two,\" directed by one of my favorite directors, Denis Villeneuve, depicting the second half of Frank Herbert's first Dune book. I must say, the film impressed me; it's a true masterpiece, especially following the incomplete first film.The film begins with Paul and Lady Jessica joining the Fremen at the end of the previous film. The Fremen consider Paul a messiah, and they aim to make Lady Jessica a Reverend Mother, giving her the Water of Life. However, due to Lady Jessica's pregnancy, it affects the unborn child, and they start communicating. Meanwhile, Stilgar, the leader of the Fremen, is training Paul. However, despite the extensive training section in the book, it was rather brief in the film - it could have been longer.After the training, Paul rides a sandworm, completing his education. Paul and the Fremen then begin their attack on the spice refineries of the Harkonnen Dynasty. During the conflict, they encounter Gurney Halleck, his father's commander and trainer, who reveals the existence of atomics, stating that only Paul can activate them due to his genetics. Paul is now widely regarded as a prophet, and his fame is spreading.While Paul and the Fremen are engaged in these activities, we are introduced to the Emperor and Princess Irulan. The princess suggests that Paul could ascend to the throne after her father, and the Emperor mentions Feyd-Rautha, hinting at his potential.Feyd-Rautha, the insane nephew of Baron Vladimir, is introduced, showcasing his ruthless acts in gladiator arenas. After his brother's failure, Baron Vladimir grants him power, and he initiates an attack on the Fremen sanctuaries.At this point, Paul, following his mother's request, drinks the Water of Life, gaining the ability to see the past and the future. He sees his sister, played by Anya Taylor-Joy - a surprising revelation. Paul then falls unconscious, and Zendaya's character appears, engaging in nonsensical dialogue and shouting at Lady Jessica.When Paul awakens, he has become a true Messiah who knows everything, and everyone now obeys him. Emperor Shaddam arrives, holding Baron Vladimir accountable. A war ensues, with Paul and the Fremen attacking. Baron Vladimir seeks help from other major houses, but the battle scene, although visually stunning, is short and could have been more substantial.Paul arrives and kills Baron Vladimir. He informs the Emperor that he will become the new ruler by marrying his daughter. The Emperor is restrained but helpless. A conflict arises between Paul and his cousin Feyd-Rautha for control of the empire. Despite sustaining severe injuries, Paul kills Feyd-Rautha. When Paul attempts to kill the Emperor, the Princess intervenes, stating, \"The father's blood has been shed,\" and Paul kisses the Emperor's feet.Paul instructs the other houses to destroy spice refineries and submit. When they refuse, Paul declares war, initiating inter-house conflicts.Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed the film, especially as it successfully concluded the unfinished story from the first installment. The narrative was compelling, although it left some aspects unexplained, assuming viewers were familiar with the books. The film's initial inspiration from the Mahabharata and other myths added to its appeal. As for Hans Zimmer's music, he once again delivered a masterpiece; the theater experience enhanced the already excellent soundtrack. The screenplay and story were exceptional, making it one of the best cinematographic experiences I've witnessed. Denis Villeneuve's direction was impeccable, and the visual direction was also praiseworthy. In conclusion, the film ties up the story of the first film and sheds light on the potential for a third installment. The music and cinematography are outstanding, making it a must-watch in theaters. In a word, it's a masterpiece.", "rating": 9, "sentiment": 1, "date": "2 March 2024", "name": "saiddogan-10326"}

It is impossible not to comment on the action scenes, as in the first film there were few and not many were well directed, here Denis Villeneuve corrects this small flaw and delivers breathtaking action scenes, especially the large-scale war (holy war) of the third act of the film, which can easily be compared with the epic battles of the Lord of the Rings franchise.

Other critics have noted the similarities in quality and scope to The Dark Knight and The Empire Strikes Back, and I can do nothing less than agree.This film spins further on and develops the ideas of the original film in far more complex manners - good and evil is not as clear, and it feels like a very human and poignant commentary on the dangers of following prophets and charismatic leaders. It is indeed a vast characterization, wonderful acting and writing - that works on its own, yet leaves the door open for a potential third film.It is a bit more unconventional than the first film in terms of its pacing, storytelling and artistic merits - yet similar enough to stand as the second chapter.The cinematography, cutting and editing is of course incredible, and very revolutionary.

The costume design is particularly striking, and the ensemble cast delivers standout performances across the board.However, there are some drawbacks: Around the midway point, something felt off. Rebecca Ferguson and Timothy Chalamet's characters seemed to undergo a sudden transformation, almost as if they forgot who they were. While character development is expected, this shift felt jarring and poorly explained. The pacing also felt inconsistent, with moments dragging while others rushed by. This reminded me of the character arc of Daenerys Targaryen in Game of Thrones, where her evolution felt sudden and unearned. Additionally, the desert setting dominates the film, creating a feeling of monotony throughout.

{"id": 627, "title": "Dune: Part Two offers a satisfying conclusion to a spectacular duology, a cinematic masterpiece and among the best sci-fi films", "content": "Beginning where Part One ended, the second part of Dune arrives and met my expectations, it's as big and impressive as its predecessor, full of spectacles. What Dune: Part One accomplished and established, Part Two enhances every corner and creates an even fully realized world and universe which makes you want to see more of it. Denis Villeneuve and the work by cinematographer Greig Fraser and production designer Patrice Vermett, it's together and their work which makes the brilliance which ended up on the big screen. Again, Denis Villeneuve and Greig Fraser create some truly stunning and spectacular shots, with Villeneuve making the best use of his mise-en-scene which he so often does. Denis Villeneuve co-wrote the screenplay with Jon Spaihts and served as a producer. Dune: Part Two is cinema, having some of the finest writing and direction but also aesthetics. It's a film like no other.Paul Atreides unites with Chani and the Fremen while seeking revenge against the conspirators who destroyed his family.Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet, Rebecca Ferguson, Josh Brolin, Stellan Skarsg\u00e5rd, Dave Bautista, Zendaya, Charlotte Rampling, and Javier Bardem reprise their roles from the first film, with Austin Butler as Feyd-Rautha Harkonnen, Florence Pugh as Princess Irulan, Christopher Walken as Shaddam IV the Padishah Emperor of the Known Universe and head of House Corrino, and L\u00e9a Seydoux as Lady Margot Fenring joining the ensemble cast. To name a few great performances, I would have to say Rebecca Ferguson and Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet along with Zendaya with Javier Bardem shining the most with his charismatic performance, in the new cast it was Austin Butler and Florence Pugh. Austin Butler was terrific in the role but should have been in more scenes to make him into a more three dimensional character which I expected from the film. Another new actor is Christopher Walken and although I really like him as an actor, he wasn't right for this role, but it's such a small (but important) role that it was easy for me to look past. Walken portrays the arrogance perfectly though. There were just too few scenes of these new characters, people who we didn't really get to know, except for Florence Pugh's character who through narration and plenty of scenes which makes us get to know her. I've read a criticism about too much star power, I don't necessarily agree but worth pointing out.The showdown between Paul Atreides and Feyd-Rautha Harkonnen in what is the final fight/action sequence in the film, it met my expectations. The fight was well choreographed and was shot perfectly, using the silence to make us hear every hit and build up the tension even more. Dune focuses on spectacle and big epic scenes that have a huge amount of suspense and tension in them, you sit on the edge of your seat multiple times. The narrative focuses on the relationship between Paul and Chani, something we saw in the dreams in Part One, in this film we get to see that play out and although their chemistry isn't the best, it's still believable and a big reason I believe people criticize the chemistry is because of Chani not having the same beliefs and also of being her own person who have doubts on Paul and other things, the two had just met after all. Regarding Paul Atreides and his character arc throughout the film, being Lisan al Gaib (the Messiah), he's scared of his visions and what that'll bring. His character arc goes with Chani's own as well. This is one of those chosen one stories that have such depth and make this formula fresh again, which it was when Dune was released (1965). Back to another sequence, the gladiator scene which is also the big introduction scene of the new antagonist and nephew to the Baron. Villeneuve and cinematographer Greig Fraser had filmed Feyd-Rautha's gladiator sequence in black-and-white by mixing monochrome with color photography, making it a strange yet mesmerizing sequence which has you in awe. It contributes to the aesthetics.About the film's aesthetics and costumes, Erik Kain of Forbes wrote this, \"The film's aesthetic is superb and distinct and feels more fleshed out than the first film-from the Bene Gesserit in their veils to the masked bodyguards in the arena with Feyd-Rautha. Costume and set design goes above and beyond, giving us a fully realized, wholly unique and immersive sense of place throughout the film, whether in the deserts of Arrakis or the green gardens of the Padishah Emperor.\" I agree fully with this. This film looks absolutely gorgeous and along with the beautiful cinematography, the aesthetics are the major component which makes it such a gorgeous motion picture. Denis Villeneuve captures cinema masterfully with using dialogue sparsely and choosing instead to use the shots set up and photographed, that's what's interesting with cinema and photography, how a picture/frame can say more than words ever could. There were a few scenes which could have had less dialogue, which makes his comments here not that positive but then again, I understand him. \"Frankly, I hate dialogue,\" the filmmaker told The Times of London in a recent interview. \"Dialogue is for theatre and television. I don't remember movies because of a good line, I remember movies because of a strong image. I'm not interested in dialogue at all. Pure image and sound, that is the power of cinema, but it is something not obvious when you watch movies today.\" like I said, I understand him, image and sound is extremely important. Again, those things are two highlights. The sound design and musical score is spectacular and seeing it in the cinema only enhances it with music and explosions among other things like the sand worms, it was loud and you felt it all around you, Dolby Atmos was just superb and needed for the experience Dune has to offer. Hans Zimmer's musical score is once again a big highlight. To another critic's thoughts, Peter Bradshaw for The Guardian, awarded the film four stars out of five, writing \"Denis Villeneuve's monumental adaptation expands its extraordinary world of shimmering strangeness. It's impossible to imagine anyone doing it better.\" Villeneuve did the impossible with adapting Dune, combined these parts make into a masterpiece.I was completely mesmerized when I left the cinema, now a day after, having time to reflect on this massive and epic movie, a film I completely love. Yet, I liked Part One more. Saying that, you'll have to understand how I rate this film, technically and everything Denis Villeneuve and his crew contributed to the film, what the actors did with their well written characters. This film is perfect in lots of ways and met all my high expectations. Something else worth noting is how the film clearly sets up a third film, based on Dune: Messiah (second book), which Denis Villeneuve has said he's interested in adapting. There's one criticism I got though, how the timeline is quite too fast paced with months feeling like weeks, I would have wanted the film to be longer and the second half to be paced slower. I expected more of a war in the second half, things I wished to see happen off screen. More politics and intrigue was needed as well. Yet, I loved every second of the film, my rating is perhaps 9.5 but it's a great followup which focuses on the Messiah and religious aspects, leaning into themes of power and fanaticism.", "rating": 10, "sentiment": 1, "date": "1 March 2024", "name": "Holt344"}

The film showcased breathtaking landscapes of Arrakis and introduced intricately designed sandworms that were nothing short of awe-inspiring. The meticulous attention to detail, combined with cutting-edge cinematography, brought the Dune world to life in ways that exceeded my expectations. The visual prowess of the movie, particularly during the exhilarating scenes where the Fremen and House Atreides orchestrated a meticulously coordinated assault, unleashing a symphony of destruction from every conceivable angle.

The pacing is also a bit hit and miss, with some parts/scenes feeling rushed (the ending, Paul's transformation into Lisan al-Gaib).The bad:\nWhy, oh why did they completely ruin the relationship between Paul and Chani? It's a key part in the book! She supports him 100% in his decision to marry Irulan and his rise to power. Is it because she must be seen as a 'strong and independent woman'?The Harkonnens have become cliched comic book villains, far from the intelligent, sinister and calculating antagonists of the first movie. Virtually nothing is seen of the emperor and Irulan. They may as well not be in it.The timeline is crammed into about 6 months rather than almost 3 years, meaning that Alia isn't born yet so Paul, not she, kills the baron. Why?! As a two year old she plays a key, and powerful role in the book.After reading some of the 10/10 reviews I'm guessing that many have needed a quality movie like this after the dross of recent years and might be getting a bit carried away in their enthusiasm!", "rating": 7, "sentiment": 1, "date": "3 March 2024", "name": "lindsayholloway"}

{"id": 642, "title": "Best Book Adaptation of All Time", "content": "This movie, in my opinion, is one of the culminations of the single best book adaptations of all time and I mean this in the strictest sense of ADAPTATION. No book-film pairing can ever surpass the LotR trilogy as an overall unit and how it turned a masterpiece into a masterpiece. In contrast, Dune 1 & 2 turns a great book (that in my opinion lags a few times too many) into a cinematic masterpiece. Did it diverge from the books in some pretty large ways? Yes. As opposed to many instances in adaptation I believe it helped drive the character conflict and the narrative while avoiding the necessary exposition it would have taken to make the cut stuff make sense, all in the context of sub 6 hours of screen time. Peter pushed the LotR trilogy to rewrite the narrative of the films to be Frodocentric and I think Denis did a similar thing specifically in this movie and turning it Paulcentric, and you might be saying well the book is pretty Paulcentric but it focuses that on his inner conflict and conflict with Chani in a way that was more distinct than the book.As an aspiring writer, I was brought to tears thinking of how I would give anything for people to sit in a theater and feel a fraction of what I just felt if I would ever be so lucky for my stories to get adapted. That alone kindled a great sense of urgency and determination in my craft. It's hard to ever say what an author would feel about a film adaptation, but I think regardless of how Frank would feel this duo of films did more than justice to the source material.", "rating": 10, "sentiment": 1, "date": "2 March 2024", "name": "buswellsean"}

Thimoth\u00e9e Chalamet's Paul finally becomes a real character, gets depth, and his evolution from homeless refugee to the victorious usurpator of the empire is totally convincing. But there are so many other actors to praise: like Stellan Skarsgard as the monstrous Baron Harkonnen, Dave Bautista as the beastly Rabban, and an almost unrecognizable Austin Butler as the hair-raisingly scary Feyd. In my opinion the part of Zendaya was less pronounced, she wasn't given much to really put her teeth in.If anything, I'm not so keen on the almost religious veil that lies over the story: the downtrodden that await and finally hail a messiah, with all the ecstatic jubilations and so on. But that's Frank Herbert's due of course. As is the Fremen's complicated language, which becomes a bit tiresome after hearing it for three hours, being forced to endlessly read subtitles.

The confidence we used to have that studios and directors were going to at least attempt to deliver to us creatively rich films that engaged us as audience in more ways than simple entertainment is all but gone. But, Dune: Part Two is a return to such films and hopefully a reminder to the rest of Hollywood that this is not only what we desire to see at the movies, but what we expect.From my perspective, a film moves from entertainment to art when it causes you to reflect on its story, themes, and the world it invites you to participate in beyond its runtime. When you find yourself reflecting on a film hours and even days after you've seen it, then it's possible you've viewed a work of art. Director Denis Villenueve has done that, made a work of art.Come for the sandworms, the sci-fi action, and stunning visuals of the world of Dune.

The scenes under Giedi Prime's black sun are so beautiful that it's almost a shame when the Arrakis colour returns. The stark contrast is perfect for the two warring houses. Everyone plays their roles well; I adored Javier Bardem's devout Stilgar and Zendaya's defiant Chani. Of course, this is definitely Timothee Chalamet's film, though Austin Butler steals every scene he's in.So what are the problems? Well, I understand that it's hard to adapt such a huge novel into just two movies. The pacing felt right, up to a point; another movie would have been just right, imo. And doing away with the character of Alia (cameo and womb-voice notwithstanding), that feels like a mistake to me. When I read the book, it felt like Alia was the most dangerous character in the whole story, the culmination of the Bene Gesserit's scheming. I understand it's hard to find a young actor who could pull that off (they'd need Fanning levels of maturity) but there were surely ways around it, rather than just omitting her altogether. Chani and Paul's relationship was also rushed. Again, I understand not wanting to add in young Leto, but I think condensing the second movie into a few months was a mistake, especially when Princess Irulan comes on the scene; it gives the impression Chani was simply a fling, when she absolutely wasn't.TL;DR: If I hadn't read the book, this would be a 10.

In Part 2 of Dune, there are not many deep implications regarding either colonization or environment, even family relationships. There is only Paul's unavoidable fate to become a ruthless tyrant. @ Cineplex Riverport IMAX.", "rating": 8, "sentiment": 1, "date": "26 February 2024", "name": "s-15230"}

The slow churn of the part I sets this film to create what Marvel took a dozen films to do.Although I must admit when I rewatched Part I I still felt like so many bits didn't stick, the planet, the race, all the family names. I felt like this didn't impact me for Part II, like any piece of Art it's better to appreciate more than once and over time.It makes me think, this is like if Star Wars was created again from today, pure escape, pure cinema.The visual and sound effects (Hans Zimmer) are perfect, not a futuristic city, just a desert wasteland captured in its essence. Just know, not every film maker can pull off riding giant worms.Flowers have to be given to the casting and acting, each of these charectors stretch further into the best they can be. Timothee Chamelet's arc is spot on, Austin Butler makes a great psychopath. My favourite has to be Javier Bardem (Jilgar) who turns from a Jedi master of his craft to an absolute religious zealot, humorous throughout.And let's not forget, as transported as I was throughout the quickest 3 hours of my life, many of this films themes of belief, power and control are clearly show influence from what happens in the real world.

This movie easily crosses that bar and puts it even higher above. It's a masterclass of film making with a visual and accoustic experience that will leave you delighted to your core. Every shot is grand, larger-than-life film making, and certainly shows every little dime of its budget, as does its set design, costumes, make-up, effect work, sound, and the INCREDIBLE score by Hans Zimmer. An epic piece of cinema we haven't seen since the Lord of the Rings movies over 20 years ago.It wouldn't work though without an fitting cast. Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet delivers a presence I didn't think was possible. Zendaya does a lot of heavy lifting, while Javier Bardem mixes his amazing role as the true believer Stilgar with some subtle bits of humour. Austin Butler's Feyd-Rautha is a terrifying psychopath you enjoy hating while he's on screen.I may see this again soon, but what I really need is more.

{"id": 661, "title": "The Impossible Burden of Dune Messiah", "content": "Part 1 kept me glued to my chair for 2 and a half hours. I am a big fan of the source material and I was blown away by what Villeneuve did with it. Expectations for Part 2 were high and oh my, did he deliver...This one is 15 mins longer but if it were 5 hrs I wouldn't have minded a bit. A lot has been said already on the strong points of the movie and I will not repeat them. There is also criticism and all I can say is, I get it. I didn't see any weak points at all myself, but I acknowledge that some people won't like the visual style, the narrative or the way it is brought to screen. If any of these things bother you, I won't judge you. All I can say is that personally, I want to be buried in this film. Villeneuve did with Dune what Peter Jackson did with Lord of the Rings: the impossible. He visualised what was thought to be unfilmable. And arguably, he even did a better job than Jackson (blasphemous thought, I know, but there it is). What made all the difference (in both these cases) is the unrelenting vision of the director. Jackson is a fan of the source material and he wanted to do it justice. Villeneuve went a step further. Not only is he a fan of the source material, he used the opportunity to make a film that is actually MORE true to the source material than the source material itself! Frank Herbert was disappointed that his intentions were misunderstood by most readers in the sense that Paul was seen as the obvious hero, instead of a false messiah. Villeneuve's interpretation is more clear on that part than the book, a change that would certainly be approved by the author if he were still alive.But this is what makes me very, very afraid of what is to come. Dune Messiah was Frank Herberts remedy for the first book. It hammered the point home that Paul is not a saint but a conqueror. It's a devastating end to Paul's saga and as people who read it may remember, it also ends in a devastating tragedy for the main characters.Villeneuve will do the 3rd movie, we already know that. He will bring the second book to screen and that is absolutely a.m.a.z.i.n.g. News. Because by now, we all know he will do the story justice, even if the studio will not want him to. Because let's face it: if he tells the story truthfully, on paper that should be the end of the franchise. That is what haunts me. The incredible prospect of the 3rd movie that is now a certainty and the fear that it will be the last.The 3rd book (Children of Dune) is the redeemer of the 2nd. It's weird, strange and yet compelling but also seemingly impossible to visualise. Who will do this if not Denis Villeneuve? More importantly: who will DARE this if not Denis Villeneuve?And, further down the line: who will ever give us the God Emperor (book 4)?", "rating": 10, "sentiment": 1, "date": "11 March 2024", "name": "Jan1968"}
{"id": 662, "title": "Under the sands was buried an addition to the sci-fi genre that carries some spice: A Review of Dune 2", "content": "Denis Villeneuve's Dune 2 has personally done for me what Revenge of the Sith done for many parents watching it when it first released. The development of the story of Paul Atreides is shaping itself to be a tragic one, reflective of the story in the book. Paul Muad'dib is sadly taking his own Anakin-like route down this fictional universe.What Dune established is further cemented and cemented very well by Dune 2, Denis Villeneuve has delivered a groundbreaking addition into the Science-fiction genre and it is one that in comparison to its sluggish predecessor, is one to remember. There are emotions here and such a connection to this universe that is crafted that cannot be said to not be genuinely making you want to see more.As we follow the story of the Fremen and Paul Atreides' (Timothee Chalamet) fulfilment of his true legacy, we start to wrestle with the dangerous idea of faith and despair - for the struggles of the Fremen can only be ended by the arrival of the Lisan Al Gaib - this being a sacrificial path to take. The world building Denis Villeneuve puts into play is to me\nlike none other that we've seen for a long time, of course Dune 1 is equally as amazing yet what Dune 2 manages to add on is just unbelievable.Regarding the casting, there are some soon-to-come Oscar's whose rightful owners should belong to the cast of Dune 2. Timothee Chalamet for one has undoubtedly proven himself in recent years as one of this generations acting powerhouse - from his flamboyant portrayal of Willy Wonka to his role as the deeply confused teenager Elio in Call Me By Your Name. His portrayal of Paul Atreides in this installment of the Dune universe is gripping and impactful, we are seeing a \"troubled villain\" in the making and his portrayal of the religiously haunted saint of the Fremen is incredible, as he balances saving those he cares about with discovering who he truly is. As for Chani (played by the talented Zendaya) there is not much to say due to sheer awe. Zendaya is an emotional lead and a powerhouse at the front of the Fremen, she embodies the struggles of the people of the dunes battling the corruption of religious fanaticism. I was also very charmed and taken off guard by the sheer excellence of Austin Butler's Feyd-Rautha, the new governor of Arrakis. To say he may be the best villain since Heath Ledger's much respected Joker would not be undeserving praise. However, Feyd-Rautha sadly suffers from the issue that comes with killing a villain off too quickly, being that his true potential is not fully witnessed. It was also very nice to see the lovely Javier Bardem play both a religiously devoted fanatic and Timothee Chalamet's biggest hypeman, though I do wish Dennis Villeneuve had explored more the gripping conflict plaguing his mind - due to Stilgar being a plagued man in the books, struggling with his devotion to this prophecy. As for the rest of the supporting cast - whose roles though at times did not take the spotlight as much - don't leave much to be said except for sheer appreciation for such a passionate portrayal. Rebecca Ferguson stepping into the reverend mother identity of Lady Jessica and giving up a lot of the things she cared for is such a sad portrayal of a mothers sometimes sacrificial role. Equally, Josh Brolin (Avengers Endgame, No Country For Old Men) and his portrayal of Gurney is better than ever with his character truly being such a good shoulder to lean on for our young Atreides. The whole cast is deserving of so many applauds for their chemistry and ability to connect to bring this universe alive, never felt more connected to a cast and their characters who I have now\ncome to love.The world of Arrakis and its other less explored planets also never feels more alive and that's not because they are genuine real\nplaces but rather because Greig Fraser's cinematography has managed to make the dunes of Arrakis as real as possible. The visuals - to say they are captivating - is an understatement, this is a world that feels alive filled with grief and hopelessness in the very sands and through its very people, the Fremen. Greig Fraser builds such a beautiful Arrakis - utilising the Panavision H-Series lenses and the re-housed Soviet Helios 40-2 Lens from The Batman - that it is simply\nmesmerising. Also absolutely loved the experimentation with Feyd-Rautha's black and white intro scene, I always love when black and white is incorporated into modern cinema, it gives films such a charm.As for the soundtrack that is largely on repeat as this is being written, from 'Cornfield Chase' to 'A Time of Quiet Between the Worms', Hans Zimmer once again develops his case for this generations and the past's greatest composer. The World of Arrakis, the emergence of the Shai-Hulud and the evil of the Harkonnens's cannot be bought to life without this soundtrack. 'A Time of Quiet Between the Worms' and its explosive counterpart, 'Beginnings Are Such Delicate Times' are genuinely two soundtracks that have made me so reminiscent of Gladiator's 'Now We Are Free', another genius score from Hans Zimmer.Denis Villeneuve's Dune 2 is deserving of a cinematic legacy, to be remembered as one of those greats and equally to be loved, for a film such as this comes once every 20 years. No\nmovie in recent years has quite made me feel\nquite like a kid and taken me, for 3 hours, to a completely different world. People should genuinely give Dune 2 the chance it rightfully deserves and cherish this cinematic experience for it does not happen as often as we wish it would.

{"id": 663, "title": "Dune: Part Two (2024, Denis Villeneuve) Villeneuve continues the visually stunning 'Dune' with added action spectacle", "content": "Eric's Grade: A-\n'Dune: Part Two' continues the epic science fiction saga begun by Villeneuve in 2021. While this sequel was always planned it was not greenlit until the first film demonstrated itself to be profitable.Every actor who's character survived reprises their roles here including Timothee Chalamet, Zendaya, Rebecca Ferguson, Josh Brolin and Dave Bautista among others. New additions to the already impressive cast list include Austin Butler, Christopher Walken, Lea Sedoux and Florence Pugh. It is important to note that this is not a true sequel as Villeneuve split the novel into two parts for filming so really this is like the second half of a story already in progress. That said they did find a good place to split the two so that they do feel like somewhat complete story arcs. While nothing is written in stone the finale of this film strongly points to the possibility of at least one more Dune film at some point in the not too distant future. While there are a few points of divergence these 'Dune' films remain, for the most part, fairly faithful adaptations of Frank Herbert's source material which makes fans that much happier with the finished product.Following the events of 'Dune: Part One' House Atreides has been all but wiped from existence by the Harkonnen's with the Emperor's implicit support. However Paul and his mother Jessica were able to escape into the desert and are hiding out with the Fremen who are the indigenous desert dwellers. While at first treated as outsiders Paul and Jessica embrace Fremen ways and fight and live along side them. Jessica eventually goes through an ordeal to become the Fremen's new Reverend Mother, and Paul continually gains followers and power taking the Fremen names \"Usal\" and \"Muad'Dib\". They are also reunited with Gurney Halleck who the stumbled across working as a smuggler thinking all of the Atreides dead. Paul fears gaining too much power as the Fremen messiah, but that seems like the inevitable outcome of his plan for revenge on House Harkkonen. As the situation on Arrakis becomes more unstable the Baron replaces his nephew Rabban with his more phychotic nephew Feyd-Rautha as governor on Dune. The Bene Gesserit also have plots in place, but all bets are off when eventually the Emperor shows up on Arakkis as Paul and his now loyal Fremen attack with sandworms and a hidden stockpile of Atreides weapons. While this may seem to end in a victory if you know Dune this is only the first step in a much larger conflict.Like 'Part One' this film is stunning in its visual presentation. The production design is incredibly impressive in everything from costumes to locations and everything in between. The script does an impressive job of capturing major plot points as well as the overall theme of the novel without sacrificing too much in translation. The returning cast as well the new cast members are all stellar. I don't think I can point at one casting decision that doesn't work. This second volume and the culmination of this portion of the Dune story certainly feels a bit more superficially satisfying as this sees Paul get his revenge on those who destroyed his House and killed his father and close friends. I say superficially because this feels like a hero's quest, but if you pay attention Paul's fears about what is to come are very pronounced, and prescient. Despite knowing that he is opening a Pandora's Box he eventually embraces the role of messiah, and strides forward knowing full well the jihad he is unleashing on a galactic scale. 'Dune' is very much not based on a rousing, audience friendly ending despite appearances to the contrary. If it were Paul and Chani would have rode off into the sunset on a sandworm together. Despite their love, and whether she understands it or not, she is forced to see Paul enter a political romance with the Emperor's daughter. There is a lot in the layered plot to absorb, and I can only hope we can see all this continue to develop in at least another future film. 'Part Two' is a natural continuation of the first film although there is more impressive action here to gawk at as well as sandworm riding, and some intense fights including the climactic battle between Paul and Feyd-Rautha. Every element of this follow up film is functioning at the highest level and combine to put 'Dune: Part Two' on a list of the best films of the year before the year has even begun to develop.", "rating": 9, "sentiment": 1, "date": "12 March 2024", "name": "hoernkeem"}

{"id": 668, "title": "Denis Villeneuve's Sci-Fi Epic Is Gigantic, Incredible & A Modern Cinematic Achievement", "content": "Dune 2 (2024) :\nMovie Review -Dune 2 Review : First of all, let's hail the great Denis Villeneuve for getting one of the greatest casting coups on board for Dune 2 with Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet, Zendaya, Rebecca Ferguson, Josh Brolin, Austin Butler, Florence Pugh, Dave Bautista, Christopher Walken, L\u00e9a Seydoux, Stellan Skarsg\u00e5rd, Charlotte Rampling, and Javier Bardem. Secondly, let's hail the genius filmmaker for his extraordinary vision that he has kept hidden for years. He was so busy with story-driven films, so we all thought that he couldn't make a big-screen spectacle like Cameron or Jackson. Dune 2 proves that he has enough fire to light the big screen with his astonishing direction skills and visionary storytelling. Dune 2 surpasses the grandeur of Dune Part 1, or, for that matter, any Hollywood movie in recent times, except Avatar: The Way Water. The said Pandora's Blue Tale lacked a unique story, but Denis got it here for his dusty desert tale. So it's like it's a visual spectacle meeting a tremendously rich script. You can't afford to miss that, can you?Paul Atreides (Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet) is accepted in the Fremen tribe and is trying to be one of them. While he is getting better during the trailer, Stilgar (Javier Bardem) informs Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson) that their Reverend Mother is dying, convincing her to become a replacement by drinking the Water of Life, a deadly poison that is fatal to males and the untrained. She drinks it and turns herself into a mother Reverend, but because she is pregnant, it might turn ill on her. She starts speaking to her unborn child, a daughter, who keeps guiding her on what to do next. Meanwhile, Paul embraces the Fremen ways and learns their language, passing tests like riding a sandworm. He begins a romantic relationship with Chani, becomes a Fedaykin fighter, and assists during raids on Harkonnen spice harvesters, earning the mantles \"Muad'Dib\" and \"Usul,\" by which the Fremen identify him as the \"man who leads the path.\" On the other hand, Baron (Stellan Skarsg\u00e5rd) demotes Rabbani (Bautista) for humiliating the family by running away from the fight and makes psychotic Feyd-Rautha (Austin Butler) a new leader. Paul Muad'Dib leads the troop to the south and is joined by the former military leader of Atreides, Gurney (Josh Brolin). Will Paul be able to defeat Baron and Feyd-Rautha?Dune 2 is an engrossing script that lasts for 160 minutes without becoming dull. Yes, there are a few moments that feel slow, but nothing too serious. The conversations are engaging, and some comedy scenes also work despite repetitive lines. Dune 2 scores high in visual presentation. It's an alien world with human-like characters, but it's completely out of your imagination. That's the power of the sci-fi epic genre, right? You must create a world that hasn't been seen or imagined by others. Only then can you convince viewers to believe in your vision and fantasy world. Every single feature of Dune 2 is a prime example of a creative sci-fi world. You get to see new kinds of clothes, people, soldiers, weapons, gods, spiritual idols, wars, and what not. The desert, storm, attacks, machines, flying machines, and what not-how on earth did Denis visualise all these alien things? And the bigger question is, how did he bring them alive on screen without any compromise? That's the most stunning part of Dune 2, and that's more than enough reason why you should not miss this larger-than-life spectacle on the big screen.Dune 2 has a solid acting unit. Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet may have just gotten the role of a lifetime, and how bleeding good he is as Paul Muad'Dib Usul! You get to see a wonderful transformation from him, and he is likely to take it to a whole new level in the upcoming Dune movies. Zendaya has given a great performance despite many limits to her character. Rebecca Ferguson will stun you with her deadly role in this one. Let me warn you, she is not the same Rebecca/Jessica you saw in Dune Part 1. So, be prepared for a surprise. Austin Butler fits well as a new antagonist, but I think he should have had more scenes. Josh Brolin and Dave Bautista were good in their roles, while the female side was well managed by Florence Pugh and L\u00e9a Seydoux. Christopher Walken and Stellen Skarsgard get some important scenes, and they show what experienced actors can do. Charlotte Rampling hardly shows her face, so I couldn't catch any expressions, but the voice tone was nice. Javier Bardem will go down as one of the best characters from Dune 2 for his involvement as a character and its growth as well. All those comic punches were hit by him only.Dune 2 has eye-pleasing cinematography (Greig Fraser) and a terrific background score by maestro Hans Zimmer. Joe Walker's editing keeps you on the edge of your seat despite the long runtime. I used to say that a long runtime doesn't hurt if it's Avatar 2 and Oppenheimer. Now, I'll add Dune 2 to that sentence. Keeping audiences interested in your story for 160 minutes is a big task nowadays. Dune 2 passes that litmus test too. Now, come to the captain of the ship, the master, the great Denis Villeneuve. I have been a huge fan of Incendies (2010), and I always believed that Villeneuve was better with such pathbreaking stories and thrillers, not grandeurs. Well, he proved me wrong, and I am so happy. Dune 2 comes as a testament that Denis can handle big-ticket entertainers too without hurting his content-loving fanbase. You may be a Marvel or a DC fan for their explosive entertainers, but the real \"Marvel of a cinema\" is here. Dune 2 has some outstanding war scenes that come with incredible vision and fantastic storytelling by the master filmmaker. In short, it's like Cameron meets Scorsese! I said it there, and I am so proud to say it. Overall, Dune 2 is stunning, incredible, wonderful, and anything close to whatever you call a modern-age sci-fi classic. Do yourself a favour and watch it in IMAX. The experience will shake you.RATING - 7.5/10*", "rating": 7, "sentiment": 1, "date": "28 February 2024", "name": "SAMTHEBESTEST"}
{"id": 669, "title": "A Sandstorm of Cinematic Brilliance", "content": "This is a remarkable feat of a movie that sets the bar very high for future sci-fi films, especially targeted towards mature audiences.Dune Part Two is an exemplar of a great 'show, don't tell' film. It treats its audience very intelligently. It knows you're wise enough to get the gist of every scene. It gives you just enough exposition and leaves the rest for you to think. It lets you experience the almost 3-hour journey by yourself without shoving down information into your throat or telling audience what everything means like you're reading a description from a book.Using a lot of religions and beliefs to support the base of the story, the script (and novels) really takes inspiration from Islam. The terms, the costumes, the designs, a lot of them resemble with the intricacies of Islam. Even the story moves in a way that was inspired heavily by Islam. There was even this one scene in particular, that the idea, strategy and the art of war were borrowed by the true story of the Conquest of Mecca, how Prophet Muhammad gave Mecca the freedom it needed from the influences and practices of the ignorance.Tis has got to be the most gigantic film this year. Yes, we know it's only February but damn, the scale of this film is so epic, you would feel the need to have an IMAX screen that is 10 times larger than what we have now. It's super massive and the camera shots really emphasize the scope the way it meant to be. Greig Fraser, the Director of Photographer knows his way in-and-out of the desert. He knows how to capture the perfect angle; the arc shot, the one shot, trucking shot, close-ups, extreme close-ups etc. He's a master at enhancing our experience by using different types of shots. He truly knows what to do with the camera. This is not a generic Hollywood filmmaking. This is art at its finest.As this film heavily emphasizes on the 'show, don't tell' approach, we have to admit that a few tiny parts had us confused. There were some things that felt unclear to us. There were things that we felt, 'Well, maybe if they could have explain to us just a bit more, we would have gotten what they were trying to tell us'.Similar to Dune Part One, Dennis Villeneuve masters at crafting environments and atmospheres that are just rich with textures, depths and dimensions. When you see it, you can feel it. When they are in the desert, you can somehow feel the warmth of the basking Sun even if you're seating cold at the cinema. When sand touches Paul Atreides' face, you can feel the sensation. When Shai al-Hulud makes an appearance, you can feel how mighty this beast is. Everything feels realistic. There's a certain weight this movie carries that immerses you completely in its world.Austin Butler nails it in his role. Out of all, he's the most outstanding. He is a vile creature that kills others for sports. His charisma is top notch. And his character alone is captivating and chilling, leaving a lasting impression on the audience. Butler's portrayal adds a layer of complexity and intensity to the film, making his scenes particularly memorable.Let's talk about the climax battle. It's ah-mazing. It's a Godzilla-sized scope that demands the widest shots you can ever possibly get. But here's the thing; it fails to maximize the build-up and scope of the action. Just when you thought things are about to get very very exciting, it ends there and moves forward with a smaller scope. All the scope they have created can be stretched with longer action scenes, specific choreographies, more spectacle visual to get the good pay-off. Tone down your expectations for the climax, if you're expecting Lord of the Rings or Infinity War duration-like action, you're gonna be underwhelmed.Timothee Chalamet's performance here is outstanding. But, we have a slight issue with his character's arc; Paul Atreides. His arc graph is well-written, up until the final 30 minutes where we felt that his character gave a bit too much emotions that don't jive with his overall arc. Towards the end, his emotional intensity escalates quite abruptly, detracting from the otherwise seamless development. While this film is already long, we felt that if they could have extended another 15 to 20 minutes to give breadth and depth to his character in the third act, it would be complete and... we would even say, sacred.His counterpart; Zendaya feels a bit lost here. She's great but she couldn't really carry her role. She's the lead, playing a prominent character but she seems superficial when she's with Timothee, which is about 80% of her screen time. She doesn't know how to balance her character with Timmy. She's timid. She appears 'less skillful' than what she's supposed to do. She doesn't understand when to give and take the spotlight to and from Timmy. Again, she's great but her acting here is just not on part with Timmy.New characters in this don't really do much for us. Well, some of them do like Stilgar who appeared at the end of Part One. But others like Princess Irulan (Florence Pugh) and Margot Fenring (Ley Seydoux) are unfortunately underused. First, their initial appearance of these characters are quite bizarre. They just sort of appear. They could have done a better way at hooking the audience with richer contexts. While the existence of the characters are important to drive the story forward, their roles feel rather superficial and lacking in depth. It leaves us much to be desired. Hopefully, they'll have more screen time in Part 3.Verdict: A cinematic tour de force, Dune Part Two is an immersive and exotic odyssey that epitomizes the enchantment of storytelling on the big screen. An epic oeuvre, it worms its way into complex narratives and Godzilla-sized dunes with a scale and scope so vast, it doesn't fit an IMAX screen. Yes, there are flaws but a novel adaptation of this magnitude is bound to have sand grains in the wind. Nevertheless, Dune Part Two's grandeur and ambition remind us why cinemas exist in the first place. This is a sandstorm of cinematic brilliance.", "rating": 8, "sentiment": 1, "date": "5 March 2024", "name": "iamianiman"}

This second one exhibits those same features, but worse.This is basically an action movie--a genre which I'm fundamentally uninterested in--which seems at odds with all the talk of Dune being characterized by complex political & economic maneuvering--of which this film does include some, albeit parenthetically. The scenes are impressionistic in their pacing and content, and expressionistic in that the photography & score are more about attempting to convey emotionality, or at least get the adrenaline pumping, than any sort of profound characterizations or themes. This is Lawrence of Arabia in space but with the Cold War as the contemporary allegory. That sort of story would still have been resonant during the post-9/11 era, but we've moved on from those wars by now into an altogether different geopolitics and political economy.The monumentalism of the shots can be impressive, and certainly the design of the mechanical vehicles is (in addition to the still-eye candy costumes), but there are too many moments where it's like watching a video game cut-scene, or even a video game playing out (c.f. The entire opening sequence). Cinema is going backwards when that's the case. And there are some egregious dissonances in the sound design, most of all in the various accents the actors were allowed to use, which takes us out of the suspension of disbelief, but also in the over-application of non-diegetic score, which treats the audience as dumb emotions-receptacles, during scenes that by-and-large do not earn such responses.(The only outstanding sequence of the film is when Paul attempts his first worm-ride, which is almost as exhilirating as the roller coaster ride it attempts to be for us on screen.)There are also weird dissonances in this film attempting to be humorous, as the on-again off-again nature of those lines (and how they're delivered) feel like a wink to the audience that this allegory of Abrahamic religions co-opting a people's revolution--albeit against a totalitarian capitalist empire, mixing all kinds of economic stages of history, much as the genres of swords & planets and sci-fi and fantasy are mixed--is not to be taken too seriously in our secular times. But then, what are we to take from this \"epic\"?", "rating": 3, "sentiment": 0, "date": "9 March 2024", "name": "LikeallHungarians"}
{"id": 672, "title": "Too busy trying to look good", "content": "It is hard not to get excited by Dune Part 2's first minutes, taking in the beauty of the photography and the elegant style of Dennis Villeneuve. But it is equally true that the excitement wears off as the film unfolds.While better and more engaging than Part 1, the story continues to struggle to catch our interest. Part of the issue is that Denis Villeneuve walks on egg shells, trying to avoid hurting any of today's sensitivities, including the promotion of religious fanatism, creating a white savior to an oppressed people or a female character who chooses to follow a man. Villeneuve navigates those risks skillfully by casting doubt on Paul Atreites' messianic nature, but it comes of course at the cost of a much diminished mythical power of the story - in a story that is fundamentally about the birth of a myth. The only magic left seems to be in the form of heavily distorted voices. To make things worse, Timoth\u00e9e Challamet, whose androgynous physique conveyed well the frailty of a young prince called to a higher destiny despite himself in the first film, struggles to transform into a people and military leader here, despite his attempts to scream very loudly and stand at the top of sand dunes with his legs open a bit too wide.The main issue however is that Dennis Villeneuve focuses too much of his attention on how the film looks, and too little on character development, plot, rhythm or excitement. While smooth surface spaceships, slow motion shots and designer sets felt refreshing in The Arrival, and to some extent in Blade Runner 2049, they begin to feel today like overused toys that have lost their shine.Let's be clear: this is still a decent film, nowhere near the depths of recent Marvel or DC universe movies, but one cannot quite elevate it to the status of Great Film. In the midst of the general indifference it generates in us as audiences, the presence of Austin Butler, however silly his character, is a standout.

{"id": 673, "title": "Worthy Sequel & Mid Trilogy Entry", "content": "SPOILERS\nI'll try to keep my review short and on point.Villeneuve sure knows how to shoot a film; I'll give him that. Part 2 is as equally absurdly beautiful as Part 1. The acting is on par with the first film, which suffices.My critique of the first film follows along with Part 2 in that I wanted this series to follow more closer to the book and the films that have come before. Major characters and plot points have been totally removed.Denis spends 3 minutes showing the audience some mundane item like a wall mural, or these sweeping images of the desert and moon; while characters and their motivations get pushed to the way side. Actors' kind of just show up, spit out a few lines of dialogue and then DISAPPEAR. The Baron (highlight of the first film for me) is barely in part 2. Thufir Hywat has been completely removed from the film, so we never see his fate. New characters with the excpetion of Feyd are introduced but serve very little to drive the story along. The entire storyline has been compressed from YEARS down to what I can determine to be only a few months on Arrakis. Alia is an imaginary character who speaks through Jessica. The Spacing Guild is never mentioned or seen in part 2. Gurney reappears and his whole suspicion of Jessica being the spy that betrayed House Atreides that night has been removed.There's just so much MISSING from these films that it begs consideration if Warner Bros/HBO shouldn't just have made Dune a series to do the story justice.With all of that said, did I enjoy Part 2? YES! Would I suggest seeing it in IMAX theaters? Well, only if that's your thing. The movie is about 2hrs and 36 minutes long. I was on the verge of feeling bored but the film picks back up just as that feeling starts to creep in. There are 3 action sequences that are 100% worth the ticket price alone, it's just that those scenes are surrounded by beautiful cinematography of mountain ranges, sand dunes, pools of water, and trivial dialogue deliveries from the star studded cast for that 2.5 hours.", "rating": 8, "sentiment": 1, "date": "3 March 2024", "name": "Braunwyne"}

However, just because something is better than its context, it doesn't mean it's absolutely perfect.Did part two bring a nerdy tear to my eye like part one? No. While part one delivered everything (minus some Tom Bombadils) that was in the book plus some scenes which weren't there but undoubtedly happened, part two makes some compromises and liberties. It's not as accurate as the TV miniseries but it's in the same league. (I'm not even going to mention the Lynch's movie which even Lynch himself didn't like.)The second half of the book (and the second part of the miniseries) takes place over years. This movie takes place over months, which is ridiculous. That doesn't give Paul enough time to become a proper Fremen, it doesn't give his relationship with Chani to solidify, etc. I do not understand this compromise, especially when (in this particular case) they could have utilized the narrator more and skip over longer periods of time as needed.The movie (unlike the book and the miniseries) never explains the source of the spice, which I consider to be a major omission.On the other hand, while this movie cuts some content which was present in the miniseries, it also covers some book content which wasn't (or couldn't have been) in there. Hence, while there is a large overlap, both the movie and the miniseries deliver something the other does not.The ending reaches a little bit beyond the book. While the book provided a solid ending, the known lore of the franchise tells us that it was merely a beginning. This is reflected in a rushed way typical for almost everything else in this movie.All in all, very good work. I wonder where are they going to take it next. Book two would be a logical choice but maybe they'll cover Brian's work first (after al, he co-produces this).", "rating": 9, "sentiment": 1, "date": "2 March 2024", "name": "jan-hranac"}

{"id": 686, "title": "Diminished", "content": "What a diminished story. A picture may be able to paint a thousand words but not with this director in charge. Not in this film. 'Dune: part two' taken together with 'Dune -part one' amount to over 5 hours combined runtime for a film treatment that is basically an old fashioned romantic adventure film told with modern technology and modern sensibilities.You could call it \"macguffin the spice story\" as the essential elements of the tale have been reduced to plot mechanics to tell a very slight story about fraught relationships and the importance of latent feminine reproductive capacities in an adversity and adventure context. Good old fashioned film making with a modern twist.On balance it seems that this isn't really a film, it isn't really part two of a film: it's simply a franchise cradle and as such it is mind numbingly diminished. If it births a franchise, which isn't certain, I won't be bothering with it; not with parenting like this film and part one.I do rate at 4/10 on IMDb, which I have readily rounded up from my considered rating of 3.5, because the first hour of this film is a bit better than a film rated less than a score of 4 deserves to be. The actors are more in tune with their performances, better at interpreting and portraying their motivations in situations. The first action set piece is the best of the film: it's interesting designed and competently delivered. I would say that it's the only well constructed action scene of the whole film. Which is a shame. I enjoyed the action sections of 'part one' far more than anything else in that film; in 'part two' however it's the opposite: the action is very poorly staged, filmed, choreographed, performed and edited whereas the efforts at dialogue and behaviour scenes are certainly better, at least in the enjoyable first hour.I am still surprised by how lacking this film treatment has turned out to be and I can only speculate that the studio wanted something unadvisable: they wanted a franchise from source material considered by many to be unfilmable. What a mistake. Over 5 combined hours and this is the sum effort? This does not reflect well on the creative and production teams. The professionals have turned in bad work. The cast, on the other hand, have done rather better. In this sense 'part two' is truly the inversion of 'part one': in the first film character scenes were bad and action scenes were good, in the second film the action is almost all poor but the actors get more meat to their characters and hence give more comfortable and effecting performances which make for more watchable dialogue scenes. This is not to suggest that the cast is blameless in my disappointed rating: they are all much better than in 'part one' but they all miss their beats, or hand in flat scenes, and appear in need of more writing, or more direction, at certain points of the narrative, but overall they are improved.Essentially, this is a sci-fi romance macguffin film and little more. It's sun bleached and parched of substance. It's \"Star Wars for everyone\" which puts it into an unfortunate contrast with it's source material.The sound design adds nothing in either effects or score, although the sound mix is better than in 'part one'; the cinematography is unsuccessful, as is the makeup and costume design and the lighting and editing hardly help with the formation of a visual pallet of moving images.Ultimately this isn't well written, and it is so diminished by that limitation that it isn't worth any more than a low rating and no further attention from myself going forward, if there is a \"going forward\" on the big screen.If you take the Dune novel, and end up with a sci-fi plot macguffin vehicle providing plot service for a romantic adventure film then you are not writing a valuable film screenplay.Such macguffins include: Spice, Sandworms, female reproduction, dukal politics, eugenics selective breeding; how can a screenplay reduce such enticing elements to this level? Incompetence or studio interference for a franchise, or both, I'd say.I rate 3.5/10 which I have happily rounded up to 4/10 on IMDb because I undoubtedly enjoyed the first hour and I thought that the cast all handed in improved, if not unblemished, efforts from 'part one'. The writing is risible and the production standards are not worth further discussion on my part.", "rating": 4, "sentiment": 0, "date": "10 March 2024", "name": "daniewhite-1"}

Looking back now that was child's play compared to what Denis Villeneuve created with Part 1 and now Part 2. His understanding of Frank Herbert's spiritual underpinnings are taken to a level of such mastery it is dumbfounding. So many moments you just are blown away with the cinematic experience, music, acting and scale of grandeur. With so much anticipation I walked away not only proud but eager now for Dune Heretics or God.The world of Harconan's was out of this world. The fierce gladiator scene, black fireworks ( So cool), the fact he was the grandson of the Baron? Lordy I don't remember that from the book (was that artistic license?). The amazing no MIND BLOWING scenes of exploding spice machines, and by far the best visual was riding the worms. So cool from side angle - then again from above! Awesome...Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet and Zendaya are magical onscreen together. There is a scene when they fall in love and their acting of being in love was there. Zendaya has done an amazing job in her young acting career. As the movie drew to its conclusion her pouty portrayal was almost too easy to get away with. But Chalamet was brilliant. On another level the ending was a bit of a disappointment. The reality of what was about to occur would have been wonderful to see or experience. That first Dune did a better job. But the religious fervor went beyond what I ever dreamed and it worked perfectly.Javier Bardem was so perfectly well cast as the true believer. He will get an Academy Award in 2025 for his performance- truly epic. I also enjoyed how Villeneuve wove in the dialogue with the unborn child of Rebecca Furguson... again a chose I wasn't expecting. The final thing that l enjoyed was the details and mood set by costumes. Again Brilliant is my only adjective..... go see it because I will at least once or twice more this week. Totally rocked my world (or galaxy).On a somber side - I missed the worms coming up to greet the great Paul Moadhib... the scene with him drinking the water of life from the worm (blue cool), was a lost opportunity for a really amazing scene. But the Director seems to have wanted to keep it less about savior Paul but reluctant God. So the scene with Zendaya's tears wasn't really all that interesting or gripping. That scene and the lack of closure? What about the waves on Dune? What about him saying to the witches \"there is a place inside the water of life that you can't look at - because it is I who is standing there\"... again artistically not my fav choice.

This film doesn't just push the boundaries of storytelling; it redefines the very essence of state-of-the-art commercial cinema.From the opening scenes to the final frame, \"Dune: Part Two\" is a visual and narrative tour de force. Villeneuve's meticulous attention to detail transforms every pixel into a work of art, creating a cinematic experience that transcends mere entertainment. It's a journey that takes audiences to distant realms, seamlessly blending broad archetypes with profound ideas, making every moment a visual and intellectual feast.The film stands as a testament to Villeneuve's directorial prowess. It not only embraces the epic scope of Herbert's novels but also captures the nuanced themes and aesthetics that have been a constant thread throughout Villeneuve's career. Each frame is a carefully crafted tableau, reflecting the director's commitment to storytelling excellence.\"Dune: Part Two\" is more than a sequel; it's a triumph of craft and storytelling. It skillfully mirrors the political intrigue of its predecessor, only to unravel deeper layers of complexity. The hubristic political gamesmanship gives way to the tragic weaponization of religion, providing a thought-provoking commentary on power dynamics and societal structures.Javier Bardem's portrayal adds an extra layer of brilliance to the film. His iconic sandworm surfing scene not only showcases the film's visual grandeur but also injects moments of sheer delight into the narrative.

{"id": 701, "title": "Dune: Part Two is a Cinematic Experience Deserving to be Seen in Theaters", "content": "Following up the critically acclaimed predecessor, Dune: Part Two brings viewers back to the world of Arrakis. Adapting the second half of Frank Herbert's original Dune novel, director Denis Villeneuve set out to decompress the epic story and tell it to its full potential. Fans of the franchise previously enjoyed Villenuve's 2021 reboot Dune, but with it being unceremoniously released mid-pandemic, its HBO Max streaming debut greatly hindered its box office numbers. Fortunately, the triumphant reception of the film demanded a continuation, delivered in Dune: Part Two.After the assassination of his father and the destruction of their new kingdom at the hands of the Harkonnen, Paul Atreides (Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet) is accepted into the desert-dwelling community of the Fremen. Though their ruler, Stilgar (Javier Bardem), views Atreides to be their Messiah, Chani (Zendaya) sees the fallen royal as the man that she loves. While Paul learns the way of the Fremen, Baron Harkonnen (Stellan Skarsg\u00e5rd) calls upon his most ruthless nephew Feyd-Rautha (Austin Butler) to aid in the treacherous spice harvest. As the opposing forces assemble, they find themselves preparing for a war for the planet Dune.Dune: Part Two is an extraordinary piece of cinema and admirably continues the story set in motion by the previous installation. Though it starts a bit slow, the tension steadily builds as the plot thickens and revelations are discovered. With each passing scene, the story weaves layers and creates challenges for the characters to overcome both physically, mentally, and philosophically. While it runs longer than the first, there are no wasted moments, and even at a nearly 3-hour runtime, it leaves audiences yearning to dive directly into Dune 3.As one of Hollywood's most prolific rising stars, Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet completely immerses himself in his multi-faceted performance. Throughout the film, Chalamet vividly explores the depths of his character, creating the most memorable role of his career. Standing amongst an exceptionally talented cast, Chalamet rises in caliber and ensures that his name will forever be synonymous with Dune.After finally uniting in the closing moments of Part One, Zendaya's Chani is given much more screen time to flesh out her mysterious character. Keeping pace with Chalamet, she flawlessly balances the constantly shifting emotional journey. Following their journey, Javier Bardem is shockingly humorous and delivers one of the best new characters in the franchise. His over-zealous personality blends with his dynamic performance as he consistently steals his scenes. In its star-studded cast, Dune: Part Two is filled with recognizable faces, although in an alien world, some aren't as easily recognized.Accompanying Stellan Skarsg\u00e5rd's ever-nefarious Baron, Austin Butler joins the cast as the psychotic heir to the throne. While his performance is mesmerizing, Butler's role feels almost redundant alongside the Baron's other nephew, Beast Rabban (David Bautista). Despite Bautista excelling in the first film, he is heavily reduced in the sequel as Butler greatly overshadows his character. Though they're both dastardly and riveting, the villainous family felt as if there could have been more to explore with its existing members, instead of continuing to add foes.With streaming services making it easy to catch the newest releases, Dune: Part Two is a film that is best enjoyed on the biggest screen you can find. Although most of the story takes place on the desert planet of Arrakis, cinematographer Greig Fraser brings Dune to life as every minute detail screams out for attention. The planet, creatures, and environment are uniquely designed and will likely be looked back on as a cinematic masterpiece. Accompanied by a chilling score from the legendary Hans Zimmer, Dune: Part Two is a feast for your senses.Dune: Part Two expertly captures a once deemed 'unfilmable' story. Flawlessly constructed by its cast and crew, every aspect of the film complements each other as they create an unforgettable experience. Akin to the release of Star Wars, Dune: Part Two is truly one of the greatest sci-fi films ever made and likely the greatest of this generation.", "rating": 9, "sentiment": 1, "date": "6 March 2024", "name": "Ltufano23"}

The performances improved since the last one, especially Timothee Chalamet as Paul, he really grows into the role here. Zendaya also gets to actually act and have a character as Chani, as opposed to the few minutes of screentime she got in the last one (and most of the time she might as well have been in a perfume commercial, no dialogue just walking through the desert in slow motion lol). Florence Pugh is excellent as Princess Irulan, though I thought some of her costumes looked a little too similar to Jessica's in the first film. Perhaps that was intentional. Rebecca Ferguson as Jessica remains the weakest of the cast but I liked her better here. I was afraid Christopher Walken would phone in his performance as the Emperor, but he does well and brings a commanding presence. I wasn't completely sold on Austin Butler as the psychotic Feyd Rautha; it doesn't help that he still has some of his Elvis voice. Other standout performances include Javier Bardem as Stilgar providing some comic relief, Lea Seydoux, who makes the most of her few minutes of screentime, and a surprise cameo of Anya Taylor-Joy as Alia in a vision of the future. They made a few changes from the book, some of which made sense (months pass instead of years, Paul and Chani do not have an infant son who is killed during the Harkonnen attack, Alia is not born yet) and others which left me scratching my head (Jessica is the daughter of Baron Harkonnen, making Paul his grandson?

It's both high art and a massive blockbuster. I'll never know what it was like to see The Empire Strikes Back when it first opened in theaters but I imagine Dune 2 comes close. A staggering leap forward from what came before it while also feeling significantly more personal. Brilliant, huge, revolutionary sci-fi. This movie is a generational masterpiece. We are so lucky to be alive to witness this movie. I have never seen anything quite like it before. For years to come, we will all talk about the wonder we experienced when watching this for the first time.Dune Part Two was vindicating. Like, less than five minutes into it, I sunk into my seat and thought \"Ok, it's somehow different (and better) than I imagined.\" It kept that energy the whole film! My mind is scrambled with thoughts, so this review might be all over the place, but regardless the main takeaway is GO SEE DUNE 2! It's the cinematic event of our generation. Believe all the hype you see. It is the realization of everything I've ever dreamed genre filmmaking can accomplish, we haven't had a genre film quite on this level since The Lord of the Rings (or maybe ever). Within the first ten minutes, I knew we were within masterpiece territory. Once we got to the montage with Paul and Chani set to Zimmer's \"A Time of Quiet Between the Storms\" (my personal favourite scene in the movie), I knew the bar had been raised. And by the time we got to the third act, well, I can't even describe the feelings of excitement I had! The third act of Dune Part Two is perhaps the most staggering thing I've ever seen on a screen. I was in tears - I've never experienced anything quite like it in a cinema before! Dune Part Two is truly something special - it is the kind of blockbuster epic we don't see Hollywood make very often these days, and that is worth cherishing. I spent most of Dune Part Two slack-jawed in sheer awe of what was on screen in front of me. This movie is soul-shattering, and yet so exciting!As I was watching the movie I realized in the moment I was likely witnessing cinematic history unfold before me - this film is a generational masterpiece on the level of The Godfather, Lawrence of Arabia, Star Wars and of course The Lord of the Rings. This movie raises the bar to a whole new level - this film stands head and shoulders about 95% of current Hollywood production. I feel so lucky to have experienced a film on this level.Denis Villeneuve's vision is on spectacular display in Dune Part Two, a bold journey that dives deep into the colliding tragedy of love and destiny. The visual language and soundscape are mesmerizing. You could feel the weight of this world sink in. The ensemble of Dune Part Two is wondrous, especially Zendaya and Rebecca Ferguson, who command the screen and communicate so much with a single look. Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet totally raises the bar with his intriguing buildup of character, and Austin Butler relishes in sheer insanity. Everyone involved, from Hans Zimmer and his mesmerizing score, to Joe Walker and his terrific editing, deliver some of their most incredible work. Greig Fraser's cinematography, however, eclipses everything. The way his images characterize the world of Dune is absolutely breathtaking and the meticulous arrangement makes every single shot look like paintings with which I would gladly cover every centimetre of my walls.Dune Part Two is a colossal action epic. The battle sequences don't take up a large chunk of time, but when they arrive, they're incredible. That final standoff between Paul and Feyd... tense doesn't even begin to describe it. This is a beast of a film, rewarding in both the thrilling setpieces and rich allegory. Denis Villeneuve's eye for action and iconography blends for a nearly flawless blockbuster, and an unforgettable cinematic experience. This is a transcendent cinematic masterpiece that demands to be experienced on the largest screen possible. Denis Villeneuve has created one of the best sequels of all time. One of the greatest sci-fi films of all time. Hell - one of the greatest films of all time. This is the Lawrence of Arabia of science-fiction epics.Dune Part Two is triumphant. A masterpiece that has to be seen to be believed. I never wanted this to end. Denis Villeneuve has crafted a brilliant, bleak, and meaningful epic that further proves he's a master of his craft. This is a sequel that takes everything that was great from the first film and somehow manages to improve upon it. And I LOVED the first film. Villeneuve has a deep understanding of Frank Herbert's iconic novel. He understands the world, tone, characters, and ideas, and yet still makes changes where necessary that I found to improve upon the book. Even more immense than the first, but much more intimate - Denis Villeneuve manages to streamline the more alienating second half of the book into a riveting, action-packed epic. For me, the whole occupies a rarified place alongside The Lord of the Rings as the definitive version of a seminal text. I think Denis Villeneuve, along with Peter Jackson, is one of the very few filmmakers to ultimately improve upon the source material. It's a too-rare blockbuster with proper meat on the bone - practically a satire of religious fanaticism at points.So rarely does blockbuster filmmaking feel this personal. You can feel Villeneuve's touch on every frame. It doesn't behave like a typical blockbuster at all. To be honest my favourite aspect of Dune Part Two is how aggressively \"anti-blockbuster\" it is. Every aspect of the standard Chosen One narrative here is filled with portent and dread. The movie doesn't want Paul to become the One. Once he does, even the \"epic final battle\" intentionally feels wrong. This is kind of the hallmark of a great sequel: Upend the audience's expectations and make them feel defeated. It is bleak - perhaps one of the most bleak blockbusters I've ever seen from a major Hollywood studio. You leave the movie feeling very somber. The film also handles its themes and characters with intent and complexity; themes of religious fanaticism, imperialism, colonialism, cultural appropriation, the hero myth exposed, the dangers of a messiah complex, fate vs free will, revenge, and ecology.Dune Part Two is an astonishing sci-fi epic that surpasses Part One in every single way. Denis Villeneuve has realized his dream of adapting Frank Herbert's masterwork to the big screen with the depth and scale it deserves in a tour de force we rarely see anymore. Truly in awe of all its craft from top to bottom and the perfect cast who bring these characters to vivid life. Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet gives one of his most captivating performances to date, certainly his darkest. He commands the screen like never before. Zendaya is the heart of the movie, while Austin Butler relishes in playing pure psychotic evil. But the scariest performance of all might be Javier Bardem who perfectly captures the novel's dangerous message of fundamentalism.In the end, Dune Part Two is a remarkable work of art. It's everything I want from cinema and sets a new standard for what we should expect from our blockbusters. It absolutely blew away my expectations and I can't wait to see it again. I don't have the words to accurately describe just how much I adore this movie. It transports you to a world of pure immersion for 3 hours and the performances are life-altering. I may see this 10 times in theatres. I can't stop thinking of how much I love Dune Part Two and how it fills me with gratitude for what cinema means to me. This is what the movies were made for. This reminds me of why I love movies. We don't get films this good as often as we ought to, so savour it. Never has a movie transported me to another planet like Dune Part Two. It is as immersive of an experience as I have ever had in the theatre and will go down as one of my all-time favourite cinematic experiences. I hope everyone gets an opportunity to see this on the biggest screen possible. There is truly nothing else like it. I LOVE this movie. Not only is Dune Villeneuve's magnum opus; it's the definitive sci-fi epic of a generation. A tragic tale of blind fanaticism and corruption. A spectacular, soulful, awe-inspiring masterclass of aesthetics and mood beautifully echoing Paul's turbulent journey, that left me utterly speechless! I can't believe we are lucky enough to have a movie like this! It left me with this beautiful feeling that I had just experienced something truly special. I teared up realizing that Villeneuve's Dune is real, that I got to see it, and it's a masterpiece.There is before Dune Part Two and there is after Dune Part Two. I don't know if the world is ready for this movie. It is gnarly. It is crazy. It is audacious. It doesn't hold back. Wow. I can't believe it exists. But it does. And it's here!

It is the very movie the cinema industry needs at this current slum in film quality.Take Madame Web, for example. A result of poor production and corrupt admin. The movie is worse than horrible because it's been flushed out of production with no second thought purely so the investors can take their bag and move on.Dune is quite literally the complete opposite of this. The developers have a deep connection to the source material, and their devotion is crystal clear.Dune: Part 2 is a culmination of hard work, dedication, commitment and the proper use of narrative storytelling and structure. There are no points in this movie where one may 'fall asleep' which was where the first movie fell off.The way in which the movie has been structured and presented allows the viewer to completely immerse themselves, making them feel like they are within the world of Dune itself, watching events play out as a warrior along Paul's side or one of his religious fanatics.The movie, in most senses, actually moves TOO fast - which may hurt the interpretation of what's presented (because most moviegoers are far too used to the poor and eye-candy structure of most current action films). But, nonetheless, if you pay proper attention and try your best to understand, you probably will.On a side note, this movie couldn't have achieved what it has without its predecessor. Many have forgotten what happened in the first instalment because of its failure to properly entertain the audience, but after breaking down the first film you can see the dependance the sequel has to the first film.One last point, this movie would not be the achievement that it is without its stunningly beautiful use of soundtrack and CGI.This film goes above and beyond in the way it integrates the music with narrative tension and overall impact. It would not have been as jaw-dropping without Hanz Zimmer's S-tier performance and love of composition - should i even mention how well he immerses himself into the film's universe to produce such fitting and unique sound?Additionally, this film stands as a manual on how to properly use CGI and stage control.

{"id": 716, "title": "Duke of Arrakis", "content": "Let me begin by saying that if Dune: Part Two was released last year undelayed, Oppenheimer would've had a formidable opponent at the Oscars.(SPOILER ALERT)The screenplay is one of the best I've seen in all commercial films, as the credit goes not only to Frank Herbert's work, but also the scriptwriter's adaptation and the director's execution. After a short monologue of Irulan that contextualizes the narrative, the movie continues with Paul's adaptation to the Fremen life, divergence with his mother's belief, and sprouts of love with Chani. Just as I thought that the story will follow the path of Avatar, the audience are pulled out of the main plot to explore other aspects of the Dune universe: Feyd-Rautha's maniacal rise, the Bene Gesserit's bloodline scheme, and Alia's subtle influence through Jessica - and then we're brought back to Paul's arc through Gurney Halleck. Although a lengthy second act, the story is compact, the development intricate, and the pacing thoroughly controlled. However, the final act is a dip compared to the meticulous lead-up, as everything seems in a hurry of wrapping up for Paul's destined ascension, most notably the war's sudden halt and the Emperor's quick surrender.Furthermore, Villeneuve maintains his high standard for aesthetic design, whether the utilitarian machinery, exotic costumes, or the panoramic long shots. What stood out to me the most was the triangular colosseum at the monochromatic planet of Giedi Prime: a dark sun hovers above waves of colorless spectators, as black blood is spilled upon white sand. Never have I thought the ink-painting-style fireworks could go so well along HR Giger's biomechanical architecture, all contributing to the portrayal of the Harkonnens' cruelty and eeriness.The action sequences are also spot-on, as Paul and Feyd's fateful duel is fluently choreographed and progressively captivating. My favorite of all is Paul's worm ride, a perfect segment in length, editing, performance, and visual. Little words were spoken, so suspense is built solely through character reaction, the sound of roaring sand, and the fastening tempo of shot-cutting. As Paul steadies himself on the worm's back, Hans Zimmer's six-note theme erupts alongside the Fremen's cheering. Chani gasps, Stilgar dumbfounded, and the Lisan al Gaib has risen.I also like how the centripetal topic of prophecy versus free will is depicted in the film. Interestingly, the movie approaches this heavy subject with comedy, for instance when Stilgar and the believers admire over Paul's humility when he refuses his identity as the messiah. However, as we accompany the young Atreides' journey up until his resurrection from the Water of Life, the prophecy, either artificially or naturally, is becoming reality as his story unfolds. Those who were laughed upon as superstitious turned out to be completely right. And yet, given Paul's unquestionable power and apathy in the end, is the prophecy truly a foresight of the future, or is it a manipulation?A movie that balances commercial needs and artistic excellence.

{"id": 717, "title": "Disappointing with an Unsatisfactory Ending", "content": "I've read the books and watched the original 1984 film before these two remakes. They altered Chani's character arc (Zendaya), making her devotion to Paul Atreides clear but adding a condition to her love that he not change, only to have him change and betray her for political power after he transformed because of consuming the spice water. His transformation into both hero and villain was evident, especially in his choice of political power and the White Princess Irulan over Chani. Unfortunately, this depiction in Dune 2 felt like a slap in the face to her character as a woman of color, which I found disappointing.Furthermore, I also found the main storyline convoluted, the subplots irritating, and the ending unsatisfactory. In this iteration of the film, it could have been titled \"True Love, True Lies and the Thirst for Power\" due to its theme of betrayal, the lack of trustworthy characters and the idea that absolute power corrupts absolutely. Additionally, the underutilization of Austin Butler as Feyd Rautha was a missed opportunity, given the hype surrounding his role. It was little more than a cameo. And in case you haven't seen the original 1984 Dune film, all of those characters were well-developed and the storyline was well-written. Sting, in that film, was a much better Feyd Rautha because his version was fleshed-out. I also didn't like killing off Duncan Idaho (Jason Momoa) in Part 1 and bringing back Gurney Halleck (Josh Brolin) in Part 2. Momoa's Duncan Idaho would have made better sense since he was Paul Atreides mentor and teacher of the \"Weirding Way\" technique, in addition to being a brave soldier. It's worth noting that critics have praised the film, and it has garnered a significant following among movie-goers.I'm wondering did all of the people giving this film (9 and 10-star reviews) actually watch the same film as I did. Yes it was a beautiful spectacle in regards to the visuals, but how the film unfolded was confusing, the writing had no depth, the worms appeared to be an after-thought and what you're left with is more questions than answers.

I think the film truly encapsulates the idea of 'there are no sides' that the books tried so hard to impart, thank you Denis Villeneuve for bringing a story I loved so much, to life, in the most spectacular fashion.\n                \n                    5 out of 8 found this helpful.\n                        \n                            Was this review helpful?

{"id": 721, "title": "Best movie", "content": "\"Dune Part Two\" continues the epic saga with impeccable casting and a masterfully crafted screenplay that captivates audiences from start to finish. The film, directed by Denis Villeneuve, seamlessly picks up where its predecessor left off, delivering a visually stunning and emotionally resonant experience.One of the standout aspects of the movie is its exceptional casting. Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet as Paul Atreides delivers a nuanced and compelling performance, showcasing his versatility as an actor. Chalamet's portrayal of Paul's internal struggles and growth adds depth to the character, making him a central figure that audiences can empathize with.The supporting cast is equally praiseworthy, with performances by Rebecca Ferguson, Oscar Isaac, and Zendaya elevating the overall ensemble. Ferguson's portrayal of Lady Jessica brings a powerful and complex dimension to the character, while Isaac's portrayal of Duke Leto Atreides adds gravitas to the narrative. Zendaya's role as Chani is ethereal and captivating, creating a chemistry with Chalamet that enhances the emotional impact of the story.The screenplay, adapted from Frank Herbert's seminal novel, is a triumph of storytelling. Screenwriter Jon Spaihts, along with Villeneuve, skillfully navigates the intricate plot, maintaining a delicate balance between world-building and character development. The narrative unfolds organically, allowing the audience to immerse themselves in the rich universe of \"Dune.\"Visually, the film is a feast for the eyes. Cinematographer Greig Fraser captures the vast, sweeping landscapes of Arrakis with breathtaking precision. The desert scenes, in particular, are both awe-inspiring and foreboding, setting the tone for the challenges that await the characters.Hans Zimmer's musical score complements the visuals, heightening the tension and emotion of each scene. The combination of Zimmer's evocative score and the striking visuals creates a cinematic experience that is both visceral and emotionally resonant.\"Dune Part Two\" stands as a testament to the successful adaptation of a beloved science fiction masterpiece. It not only honors the source material but also expands upon it, offering a visually stunning and emotionally gripping cinematic experience. As the second installment in what promises to be a landmark film series, \"Dune Part Two\" solidifies itself as a triumph in casting, screenplay, and overall storytelling.", "rating": 9, "sentiment": 1, "date": "3 March 2024", "name": "mrohith-98730"}

K so it's very fresh in my mind, i went with my Mrs who's not a great fan of these movies and actually found part one boring. But she was won over by the completion of the first book here in Frank Herberts masterpiece of novels. She actually came out the cinema and said suppose there will be a part three? And I think there was a gleam in her eye of anticipation. Unfortunately she hasn't read Dune messiah. She also looked at me and said the film trailers were kind of rubbish, and you may think this has nothing to do with my review of Dune part 2 but it has everything to do with it. When the rest of Hollywood biggest films this year in the trailers for the next few months are another Ghostbusters another Godzilla Vs Kong another Deadpool another mad max film and weird looking over the top borderlands movie.I haven't seen a single one of those movies yet but I can guarantee not a single one of those films mentioned will have better visuals, better sound, better script, better acting, better cast, better score and a perfect runtime than what I witnessed last night watching Dune part 2. This is a spoiler free review like all my reviews. And if you liked part one well part 2 just ups everything on screen.Being a huge fan of the novels and a movie lover I understand there needed to be characters cut dialogue cut, events altered and changed but as a film adaptation it's a solid adaptation. If you want the full unabridged version read the book if you want both versions like I do read the book and watch the film. I've rated this film a 10 but no film is perfect I think it's sits around 9.5 just because I've read the books and was expecting some important things in the novel to be that weren't.I must give an honourable mention to three stand out performances. Rebecca Ferguson played with awesome mannipletive intense intent her portrayal here is the unlitmate weaver of plans within plans.Austin Butler, wow I could of watched a full movie on his demonic villanery easily as memorable as the first time Darth maul turned on his double sided light saber when he's finally introduced. Javier Bardem excellent comic timing and a true believer in the cause.

The bearing of the actors in the old version really did feel like a royal lineage, the new Paul Atreides feels like a surfer dude and doesn't have the bearing and feel of a royal prince ( Kyle MacLachlan did a fantastic job and is far superior to Chalamet.)The same goes for all the other actors of the original apart from Rabban ( Bautista's version does give off a very impressive malevolent air).The new version ( although having better CGI, sound design and cinematography) lacks the intricacy, depth and overall feeling of the far superior older movie. It also lacks that mystical feeling that the old one had. The new version feels in a sense, very soulless and slipshod, from the costumes to the set designs ( Villeneuve loves to do these very minimalistic looks to his sets which don't look convincing at all.)Compare the Emperor Shaddams royal throne room in the old movie to the new movie, the old version so otherworldly, intricate and marvelous to look at.

The same goes for all the costumes from the Bennie Gesserit to The Harkonnens, the old version felt like they really put a lot of thought, effort and soul into each and every piece, the new versions felt simplistic, flat and souless.Even the still suits in the new version look far inferior to the old ones ( the older version looked neat, compact and elegant, the new version look like a patchwork of rubber).It's like Alerando Jodorowsky said:It's very well done,\" Jodorowsky said. \"We can see that it is industrial cinema, that there is a lot of money, and that it was very expensive.

{"id": 727, "title": "Religious wars from an atheistic point of view", "content": "The best film of the past four years. The film is inspired by the history of European wars and is also greatly inspired by the emergence of the dawn of Islam, but it certainly presents it from an atheistic point of view, because the writer of the novel sees the Mahdi as a dangerous person, more dangerous even than the empire, and even sees religions as something superstitious, and that view will be annoying for Christians, and of course especially Muslims, but as a Muslim I was not bothered because I understand the extent of Western writers' ignorance of the history of the Abrahamic religions and see them as religions that prevent human freedom, while in fact they ignore the history of the world before the emergence of the Abrahamic religions.Actually, WW1 and 2 were made by atheists, and even the nuclear bomb was made by atheists Hitler himself is atheist, and you can't mix with what happened to Native Americans by Christians with the Islamic Empire because Muslims during centuries visited a lot of territories in Europe and east Asia, and even they reached Australia, but they didn't make any holy war against those people. The novel and movie will provide a collective view of what happened with crusaders and the Spanish, British, and French at the dawn of Islam.The film was also much better than the first part, and even the soundtrack was better than the first part.

Dune part 2 has officially joined the ranks of The Empire Strikes Back, The Godfather Part II and the dark Knight in the greatest sequels category.Takeaways:\nTimothy Chalmet is at the top of his game here as Paul Attedies, now going by Yusl Mau-Dib. He morphs from reluctant hero, to Dark messiah figure, as he becomes more of an anti-hero by the end of the film.-Zendaya is great as Chani! They took some liberties with the character here. As opposed to the original book, Chani is more fleshed out and is more of a Vocal character. Though she is in love with Paul, she does not agree with Paul's leadership and changed attitude once he embraces his role as the \"Lessan Al-Gaib\" to lead the Fremen to a new era and a \"green paradise\" for Arrakis. She does not like that her people worship him as a \"God\" and She also does not approve of his marriage to the emperor's daughter to secure a political position of power to become new Galactic emperor.-I wish they wouldn't have cut out the part where Paul and Jessica had a child named Leto that died in an attack during the two years Paul was with the Fremen.-Also no two year time jump.-Alia Atredies also appears! She is changed from the Novel, but you will love this version potrayed by Anna Taylor JoyHonestly these changes make sense, because this movie makes the original story now more dramatic.I loved when Paul rode the sandworm! One of the best scenes!-Rebecca Ferguson just went into a Boss mode and Creepy level as Jessica Atriedes becomes the revenant mother to the Fremen and the one who makes sure that her son Paul races the final steps to his destiny.-Josh brolin and Javier Bardem are also great in their roles as Paul's trusted and loyal advisors.-Stellan Dkarsgard and Dave Bautista continue their great Villian roles as the Harkonnens.SPOILER A shocking revelation happens where it is revealed that Paul and Jessica are part of the Harkonnen bloodline. Baron Harkonnen is Jessica's true father, and Paul's Grandfather.-I always love seeing Christopher Walken and I thought he was great as the emperor Shadam Corino IV.-But the best performance in addition to Chalmet's goes to.....Austin Butler as Feyd! Such a creepy and sadistic villain and a womanizer. I loved his final duel with Paul! One of the best scenes along with Paul riding the sandworm.Conclusion: YOU WILL LOVE THIS FILM!

{"id": 738, "title": "Bear Witness to the Movie of the Year (and Next Five).", "content": "First off, Dune Part Two does justice to Frank Herbert's visions when he authored the book. The complex thoughts and writing from the novel is carried out beautifully as the story switches out between separate planets and settings, and ultimately creating different cinematic experiences every half hour or so.Focusing less on comparisons around the book, Dune Part Two feels unique to the first movie. Regarding their similarities of how Part Two upscales everything that Part One did right (and removed EVERY criticism I had with it), the pacing of Dune Part Two is crafted excellently.Each arc in the story is written and filmed like a Greek Epic, with Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet being your Heracles. Simple dialogues will distract you with beautiful sunsets and brutal battles immerse you with the sense of victory or the pain of loss.I especially was a fan of Austin Butler's performance as one of antagonists and his acting was downright horrific at times, when mere logic causes an advisor to have his throat slit due to Feyd's psychotic tendencies.Chalamet stepping up as a leader in his Hero's Journey is a transcendent experience, as he quickly transforms from bland, intelligent, and strong rich kid to a planning politician with a guide to his goals within his mind. Overall, Paul Atreidus becomes an actually interesting character.This movie had some unintentional comedic moments.

It's definitely the best creation ever made for Dune but it's not a \"masterpiece\" and the epic moments in it are so short that actually made me angry.Beside the many changes compared to the origin story (some good & some bad that I could live with), the movie focuses too much on the relationship between Paul and Chani while missing many other major issues that some of them didn't even get screen time. Chani's part is just way too big; the fact that the movie ends up with her face symbolizes that.But the thing that was the most disappointing for me is the action scenes in the big assault of the Fremen at the end; that were very epic with maybe 2 minutes long! I think Villeneuve messed this up big time.The shadukar, the strongest force of the emperor in the universe, I want to see more how it's defeated. The defeat of all the Harkonnen forces also almost nothing of it was shown. We didn't even get to see Paul storms with the Fremen and fight in this battle. At the point when they reach to the emperor and his people, there was a line of Shadukar troops walking into the fog and disappearing before Paul arrives; Why not make a small action scene there?! I really don't get it. I didn't expect this movie to contain long big scale action sequences just like Lord of the Rings movies, but it seems to me that the director was literally trying to avoid them no matter what.I've seen the movie twice since I like Dune so much. It has one of the best casts ever made (Rebecca Ferguson performance is remarkable), the story is more than amazing, the visuals & dressings are stunning, the sound off course is mind blowing- all were so excellent.This really should have been the best Science Fiction movie since decades.

{"id": 744, "title": "A Spectacular Cinematic Achievement", "content": "Dune Part Two, the second half of Denis Villeneuve's ambitious two part adaptation of Frank Herbert's seminal 1965 sci-fi classic, feels like a blockbuster to end all blockbusters, a monumental cinematic achievement. While the Lord of the Rings comparisons may be pretty obvious, especially since Herbert's novel is often considered the sci-fi equivilent of Tolkien's epic fantasy trilogy, it absolutely fits here because if 2021's Dune (or Dune Part One) felt like filmmaking on an epic scale that we hadn't seen since Peter Jackson first transported audiences to Middle Earth with The Fellowship of the Ring back in 2001, Dune Part Two feels like filmmaking on a level that we haven't seen since The Two Towers in 2002. On top of that, Villeneuve and Jackson's adaptations of their respective novels have a lot in common, as both find a perfect blend of straight up, accurate adaptation of the material while also finding ways to expand upon the themes of the novels in a way that feels respectful and makes sense.Dune Part Two is the perfect example of the \"when everybody does their part for the group project\" meme. Whether it's Villeneuve and Jon Spaihts' script, which perfectly blends humor, drama, action and even horror in a way that makes the nearly 3 hour runtime fly by, to an all time great score by Hans Zimmer, who truly feels as if he's firing on all cylinders in awaythat he really hasn't before, to Grieg Fraser's breathtaking cinnematography that brings the different planets that make up the Dune universe (Dune-iverse??) to life (the black and white gladiator arena sequence on the Harkonnen home world of Giedi Prime in particular is a key standout), to the stunning and immersive production and costume design by Patrice Vermette and Jacqueline West respectively, everything comes together to create a film that not only builds upon the strengths of its predecessor, but far surpasses it, cementing itself alongside the likes of the afformentioned Two Towers, T2, The Godfather Part Two and The Empire Strikes Back as one of the all time great cinematic sequels. That's to say nothing of the acting, which is also phenomenal. Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet cements that he was perfectly cast as the series' awkward, reluctant messiah/chosen one, Paul Atreides. While it would admitedly be easy for some of Paul's decisions, actions and dialogue to come off as whiny or insufferable, Chalamet chooses to lean into Paul's apprehension and reluctance to taking on a role/title that was imposed on him by the people around him, while at the same time, dealing with the very real grief he feels over basically everybody he loved and most of his family being senselessly massacred by the Harkonnens and basically becoming the leader of not only his family but of the royal House Atreides basically overnight, resulting in easily Chalamet's best performance to date. Rebecca Fergusson's Lady Jessica continues to metaphorically and also quite literally be mother. In fact, she's so good at being mother that this film gives her the title of Reverend Mother (which in Bene Geserit terms is basically the ultimate mother). Javier Bardem's Stilgar proves to be the comedic heart of the film while not being reduced to a laughing stock or a purely comedic character and, along with Lady Jessica, serves as the perfect representation of the film's themes of religious fervor and fanaticism. On the flipside, there's Zendaya's Chani, who, along with Paul, serves as the more skeptical counter to the adult's religious fanaticism. Chani is easily the film's MVP. After so much buildup for her appearance in Part One (which famously lead to people getting \"Zendaya-baited\" by the movie because she was such a huge part of the promotion for the film and ultimately had like 5 minutes of screentime in the actual movie), Chani both is and isn't the character you expect her to be, even if you've read the book. Villeneuve, Spaihts and Zendaya herself give Chani some much needed depth and complexity that truly elevates her character. As for the newcomers, Austin Butler is easily the standout. Butler brings all the rockstar energy and swagger that he brought to the role of Elvis but dials it up to 11 to his chilling portrayal of the murderous and psychotic Feyd-Rautha Harkonnen and steals every single scene he's in. However, not all the characters fare so well. While we certainly get more of Stellan Skarsgard's Baron Vladamir Harkonnen and Dave Bautista's Glossu \"Beast\" Rabban than we got in Part One and their performances are great (especially Bautista's, who really gets to showcase Rabban's physicality and why he has the nickname \"Beast\" in his scenes), they aren't given nearly as much depth as the heroes are. While their motivations are clearly defined, they don't hsve the depth of someone like Paul or Chani. The other newcomers who aren't Butler (Christopher Walken as the Emperor, Florence Pugh as his daughter Princess Irulan and Lea Sedoux as Bene Geserit sister Lady Margot Fenring) really drew the short end of the stick when it comes to screentime but with a story as character dense as Dune, that was bound to happen.It isn't all positive though. Even with two films that have a combined runtime of nearly 6 hours, Dune is such a dense book (the book iw over 600 pages and the audio book version I listened to on Audible clocked in at just over 21 hours), it's possible to TRULY adapt all of Dune, and some elements of the story do feel somewhat rushed due to Villeneuve and Spaihts opting to change what in the book is a time jump of a couple years during which Paul and the Fremen disrupt spice production and Maud'Dib becomes a figure feared by the Harkonnens and Imperium alike to a couple of months (if even) in the movie, which, in the longrun isn't something that deeply impacts the story, but it does make certain smaller details make less sense as we near the film's climax. That being said, Villeneuve and Spaihts are clearly aware that doing a *fully accurate* adaptation of Dune with the two movie constraint that they had was nigh impossible, so they opted to omit certain things, condense others, and in some cases, add things, all while keeping true to the spirit and themes of Herbert's novel to the point that it's clear that they both have a deep reverence for the novel. Given how Dune Part Two ends off, I have no doubt that the inevitable conclusion to Villeneuve's trilogy, Dune Part Three/Dune: Messiah will also take liberties with adapting ITS source novel as well, and if the first two parts are anything to go by, that'll be for the best.Dune Part Two is, without question, one of the greatest sci-fi films ever made and a standout in Denis Villeneuve's already incredible filmography. While it's very easy for a movie to get way too overhyped way too quickly, in the case of Dune Part Two, ABSOLUTELY believe the hype. Believe the hype and see it on the biggest IMAX screen you can, just as Villeneuve intended, or if you're lucky enough to see be living near a theater that's showing it in 70mm film, as I did for my second screening, do yourself a favor and see it in that format too.

I thoroughly enjoyed the first part, and rewatched it a week ago before watching this sequel, and it was a great film that pushed the boundaries in what Cinema can do best on a big screen. Part Two follows that same pattern, and is mostly on part with it.We have a continuation of sing our lead protagonist Paul out to fulfill his destiny is this Tatooine linke planet against the evil empire out to exploit the indigenous groups (like the unsubtly named Freman). He seeks revenge and to find himself, and clearly ther are Star Wars parallels as any fanboy of the sci-fi genre will bore about (Star Wars having been heavily influenced by the original Dune book).It's incredible to look at, with the setting and effects brilliant. The action scenes keep you going without the need to just keep going on forever trying to outdo each scene each time.The issue was though that most of the time, I'll admit I didn't have a clue what was going on!

I thought Rebecca Ferguson stole the show for me, and I loved the cameo roles by Charlotte Rampling and Dave Bautista.This is definitely one for sci-fi devotees. For me?

Yet, amidst the grandeur, there is also an intimacy to the story, as it explores themes of power, destiny, and the human condition.The performances in \"Dune: Part 2\" are nothing short of stellar. Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet shines as the conflicted hero, Paul Atreides, bringing both vulnerability and strength to the role.

There were a few changes from the book that made the story easier to digest on screen, which I felt was appropriate and made the movie better than it would have been had it directly adapted every detail of the book.I especially loved this movie's depiction of Paul's internal struggle with a desire for revenge while at the same time growing love for Chani and the Fremen people. He is clearly stuck in the middle of expectations, controlled prophecies, love, loss, and fear of greater loss and suffering. All of this internal turmoil is heard in Paul's words, tone, and seen on his face. Lady Jessica's portrayal is terrifying and unsettling. Chani is the heartbeat of the story and allows the audience a figure to connect with and respond to the events of the film with.

With 3 hours of runtime, I would have liked to see more development and explanation!A few examples of this:\n1) the scene were Paul needs to navigate the desert alone. This was supposed to be a major canonical event to show that he is the messiah. He goes out alone, is immediately met by Zendaya, and then the scene ends with no further discussion. The worm riding was similarly undeveloped (no training scenes, etc)\n2) The transformation of both Paul and his mother. They seem to both immediately jump into their new personas 100% as soon as they drink the water. I think it would have been more interesting to show them grow into their new roles, or at least show some introspection about how abrupt the changes were.A few other things I didn't love: Somehow the bald people can't defeat (or even find) the Fremen, but as soon as Austin Butler comes in he can find their shelter immediately and torch the whole thing? The Fremen have these OP laser guns but are still relying on hand to hand combat?I think the movie could also have been a little more helpful to those of us who haven't read the books by reiterating some of the lore and rules of the Dune universe.", "rating": 6, "sentiment": 1, "date": "11 March 2024", "name": "benhfairbanks"}

The Desert is all encompassing territory of the worms and the sun, with only isolated outcroppings serving as shelter. The Harkonen planet shows its system of fear and dominance through its perfect geometry, lack of individuality and overwhelming sun seeping all in black and white. The court of the emperor shows distinguished pomp and paradise (compared to the water starved Arrakas or brutalist Harkonnen).Furthermore, the film is reenforced by Hans Zimmer's brilliant scoring with each scene feeling influential through sound mixing. Battles feel violent, landscapes feel barren, speeches are underscored to capture the hearts of thousands.The characters and scenes are smartly written with both motives and cultures playing an important role. The Fremen are shown to be expertly adapted at desert life between water collection, sand walking and their abilities at worm riding. Yet, they are not uniform with the ever-present struggle of the weight of their faith and prophecies (which Lady Jessica and Paul will exploit). The Harkonen subside on a culture of fear and tyranny, where strength is found through power and where weakness is quickly snuffed out like a flame. This instills equal parts loyalty and treachery as engagement must be fanatical but advancement requires usurpation.Even Paul and his mother show much change as they struggle between their identities (Atriedes vs Fremen vs Bene Gesserit vs Harkonen), their loyalties to both friends and families and to what their end goals may be. After all, who knows how much of the original Paul or Jessica remains after drinking the Water of Life and seeing much of life's secrets?While at times half the dialogue feels like dramatic shouting it rarely feels to stall the story and instead feels like a support to the powerful scenes surrounding the speakers. Characters rarely require the need to tell what they think, rather showing it through loving tenderness or shocking brutality.Ultimately the movie offers both an epic depiction to Dune fans and a worthwhile space epic to more casual viewers.9/10.", "rating": 9, "sentiment": 1, "date": "10 March 2024", "name": "Someguy95"}

But instead i have to be honest and say that i didnt think the movie was all that great, and is massively overhyped.I felt like part one was all the buildup. So this one would be all the action. Especially as i watched the old 80's Dune a few days before. To start off with the positives. Most of the action is great. Austin Butler is also a positive as a creepy villian. But the way he just kind of shows up half way through and then doesn't do much till the finale. Is a strange choise. Especially when villians already setup in the last movie just kind of hang around.Overall I was disappointed in the film because it was way too long and slow. The plot seemed all over the place, and i struggled to take the seriousness, the overuse of made up languages with subtitles, and the daft costumes seriously. Maybe i shouldn't have gone to see it after a 10 hour shift at my work. But i still felt underwhelmed with it after such buzz.\n                \n                    4 out of 27 found this helpful.\n                        \n                            Was this review helpful?

{"id": 781, "title": "Significantly better than the 2021 film", "content": "Let me state upfront that I was not a fan of either the 1984 version by David Lynch or the 2021 version by Denis Villeneuve. Keeping in mind how highly I think of bother these directors, my conclusion in 2021 was that if Villeneuve cannot make it into a coherent and compelling movie, that just proved that \"Dune\" is unfilmable. But my admiration for Villeneuve is such that I will go see anything that he brings to the screen.\"Dune Part Two\" (2024 release; 164 min) picks up straight where the 2021 film concludes, and we are off to the races. Of course I'm not going into any plot details, I will just say that I still struggled with the movie's first hour, and I was thinking to myself (holy cow, still another hour and 45 minutes to go?\". But then the unexpected happened, as the plot started jelling nicely, and I finally FINALLY found myself becoming emotionally invested in the main characters. As for the \"action scenes\", they are quite good too. T was not quite as impressed with the score by Hans Zimmer, which feels like a less compelling rehash of his score for Villeneuve's \"Blade Runner 2049\". Speaking of which: as much as \"Dune Part Two\" has improved over the 2021 film, neither is as good as \"Blade Runner 2049\", but I totally get it that this is a subjective impression.\"Dune Part Two\" opened last weekend to unexpected commercial success. I went to see it this weekend. The Saturday early evening screening where I saw this at here in Cincinnati was just short of a sellout. So this movie looks to continue to do well, and it is almost certain that Villeneuve will make third \"Dune\" movie (to close out the story arc involving the Timothee Chalamet character). If you were on the fence about seeing Part Two, I'd readily suggest you check this out, and draw your own conclusion.", "rating": 7, "sentiment": 1, "date": "10 March 2024", "name": "paul-allaer"}

I think as a standalone movie, it's fantastic and I'd absolutely recommend people go see it in a theater if you can. Making something like riding a sandworm look cool is not easy and they do it. I had a huge smile across my face during that scene. Lots of fun. The sets are beautiful, same for the costumes. The cinematography looks great and the FX are some of the best to date.But, if you consider this movie wrt the book it adapted, it's awful. It's not Dune. There are significant thematic changes that were made and some of the best characters are not even in the movie (how could you not write in Alia!?). It doesn't address any motivations about why things happened and so most of the second and third book is just absent in the material. Very strange choice. And I don't think this is a case of there was too much so they had to make choices. Denis added stories and events that flat out aren't in the book. He chose to make it the way he did and map the issues in the book to current issues in America and the world. And for that, it's kind of a let down. More than that, it's bad. Flat out bad.

{"id": 786, "title": "Nailed everything but music missed the vibe of the book", "content": "This is not going to be a popular review but I'm writing as someone who has read the book, is a fan of Villeneuve's work and couldn't wait for part 1. And even more part 2. To arrive. After watching the first movie I understood that those who had never read the book didn't get to appreciate how perfect job Denis Villeneuve had done, but fortunately many did, me among them, as it laid the path for the second part to unveil in it's glory. And in so many ways it did. Before I went to see this movie I've read the first reviews, especially the usually critical ones from the book fans and couldn't understand why're they always so picky, especially for Villeneuve, even if the movie in some of its parts strays away from the book. Never had that kind of critical view on the book adaptations as I understood that the directors job, freedom and subsequently risk is to choose a path and express their artistic interpretation. After viewing the second instalment I still don't see any bad things about how this movie was made regardless of it's differences from the book. It doesn't lose anything from the Dune story at all. Everything about this movie is top of the tops. Except one thing. My critical point about the second part of the Dune movie is the one of the most praised things in all the reviews. The musical score from the music grand master Hans Zimmer. Everyone praised it but I found way over the top, completely missed and messed up the whole vibe. Basically from the start this music and it's effects immerse you in extremely fearful and dark vibe sound pool that never leaves this 166min instalment. There are couple of times that the music atmosphere went to a calmer side but this was like ugly vibes all over the place, regardless who's in the scene... it was a constant. My take is that classic mixing the atmospheric sounds depending on the side showing would make it definitely better because the book doesn't have that evil vibe all the time at all. The book is a clear fight of good and evil and there are many divine or spiritual moments opposing the darkness in the book that emphasize that fight, light against the dark. Even prana the yogic life force of God (from vedic culture) is mentioned in the book. Among these sound effects that were shaking the whole hall, it was hard to swallow the voice of Lisan Al Gaib's demonic voice (as well as his mother) when he became one with everything, enhanced with a cruise ship subwoofer sound effect. That being said, Timothee Chalamet is not the best pick for the role, just can't see the charisma of Paul with his skinny appearance and face, standing tough like Ronaldo before taking the freekick. Paul should have eyes that speak everything and this Italian teenager lookalike, although good, just felt flat like he's trying to hard. Zendaya surprisingly great, constantly amazing Rebecca Ferguson has that charisma of stealing the screen presence and two best roles Josh Brolin and Javier Bardem made the center of the bullseye. Movie has the perfect scenery. Really everything is spot on but the music vibe kinda ruined it for me. That's not to say that mr. Hans Zimmer made a bad product, he did masterfully as always. But compared to the book it's too extreme, too dark or evil and missing the vibe of the story, in my humble opinion. I can see that dark things excite a lot of people today and so this music score is not a surprise in that way. But not for me. Another note, the media critics are writing about this movie grandiosity by comparing it to the Lord of the rings. Love and respect both but Dune doesn't come even close to LOTR masterpiece trilogy.

I still think Dune suffers a bit from its villain problem; the big villain from Dune Part One is easily killed while gasping on the ground like a fish, and the new villain they introduced only has a couple fights in the series and feels more like a disgusting and vile piece of trash that just needs to be stomped on than an actually intimidating villain. Not to mention he dies just minutes after the other villain, and his big fight scene that is supposed to establish him as a threat earlier is against a man who has been deprived of food and is twice his age. But I'm sure that most if not all of that is in line with the book, so I can't complain too much.

{"id": 788, "title": "Cant stop thinking about this movie", "content": "This movie leaves you speechless as you walk out of the theater given its scale, length, story telling, acting, action, emotions, and the cinematography that unfolds for almost 3hrs. It takes you a while to replay in your head all the parts you liked (theres a lot) and when you finally have time to process everything some hours later, you might find yourself wondering \"Did i just watch the best SciFi movie ever?\".Those are lofty and almost unfair expectations to place on any movie. Yet, the thought crosses your mind that it might be.And the reason for that question? Part 2 pulls on your emotional strings in a way the first doesnt even try to. The relationship between Paul and Chani is complicated - both are in vulnerable places, and its that vulnerability that surprisingly makes this movie ultimately a tragedy. For the folks who see beyond all the awesome effects and the action scenes, you're actually left with a deep sadness in the end for how the two main characters stories unfold.It wasn't until the second time through watching this movie that the emotional elements resonated with me, perhaps because I knew how things ended. And they added a completely new dynamic to the film that will honestly persist for a while. Theres something heartbreaking about two young people falling in love and being apart of an epic tale, yet different worlds collide and competing views prevent that relationship from blossoming.Perhaps the only critique I have of this movie is that in the very last scene, with Chani alone on the dune looking out into the desert, about to find her own path after she's been totally betrayed in the worst way, was to have a single tear drop slide down her face as the camera goes in for a close-up. It would've driven home the pain she was feeling so much more and I think it could've left everyone (even the casual movie goers) with the correct impression about this tale. Its simultaneously an amazing spectacle but also sad.Well done, Denis and team. You've done it again.", "rating": 9, "sentiment": 1, "date": "4 March 2024", "name": "cam-gottfried"}
{"id": 789, "title": "Good Sequel", "content": "Dune Part II is a very good sequel. The world building in this movie is great and really establishes the Fremen culture. I love how the movie dives deep into how they view culture and religion and the split that they have over their belief in Paul. Timothee Chalamet is excellent as Paul Atreides. His character arc is amazing. He starts off as someone who just wants to help and then through his time with the Fremen he starts to use them and their faith to get his own revenge. Zendaya was also great and her character's dynamic with Paul was very fleshed out. I loved how she went from loving him to despising what he represents. Florence Pugh was a good addition here although she didn't have much to do. Austin Butler stole the show in my opinion. He was a perfect villain and his pure psychotic nature was frightening. The costumes, visual effects, and set design all looked great. I especially love the design of the black and white planet. There were a lot of cool things they did with it, like the fireworks for example. The action scenes are pretty good. The cinematography is very good and Denis Villeneuve crushed it directing. Hans Zimmer delivers a killer score here as he always does. I only have a few minor issues with the movie. Just like the first movie I think the pacing was a little off and despite Rebecca Ferguson giving a great performance I didn't really think her storyline was that interesting or well explained.

In this instance however I feel you still can enjoy this fully.On the other hand I do have watched the original movie as well as the previous part, which I found visually appealing but in some regards almost a trailer to this second part. The original movie from 1984 is its own chapter, and quite frankly shouldn't be associated with these films. I won't dwell more into that one here other than state that it was a ghastly picture.With Denis Villeneuve once again at the helm I expected nothing more than a visual bombardment, which you indeed received. There was more of everything in this one, the visuals were truly spectacular. The score with grandmaster Hans Zimmer complemented the cinematography masterfully.The cast was mostly competent with Timothee Chalamet being the one improving most from the returning cast. Found him engaging showing more emotion and stepping up as a leader. The love interest with Zendaya also felt bearable to watch. Some questions arose about the cast though. The most obvious was the casting of Christopher Walken as the emperor. As I wrote I haven't read the book but I have a hard time contemplating that was they way a mighty character as him was portrayed. He felt weak in every sense. Dave Bautistas character was such a footnote in this they might as well have left him out. Haven't seen Austin Butler in much, he probably is a capable actor, but here and for me he wasn't intimidating in the least. Florence Pugh and Anya Taylor-Joy were criminally underused but I recon that will change in the final part if this trilogy.The story itself took a step forward in this part, it felt more fleshed out. The problem with pacing was regretfully still somehow present, especially towards the end. You still got a feeling this was an episode rather than a movie standing on its own.But, these drawbacks should be considered minor glitches in an otherwise brilliant production.

Then we rejoiced when it was, and waited eagerly for the second half of the epic story. And after all that time, plus an extra four months resulting from the writers' and actors' strikes, it's finally here. And it was worth waiting every second for.Dune: Part Two is a staggering achievement. Villeneuve's direction on point as always, but his visionary realisation of the books is remarkable. From huge brutalist architecture to seas of desert sand, all beautifully shot by Greig Frasier at the top of his game. Particularly, shooting the monochrome sequence in infrared was a genius move and creates a deeply unsettling atmosphere for introducing Austin Butler's antagonist.Speaking of, the entire cast are in flying form, both new additions and returning favourites. Chalamet's descent from the calm and reserved Paul to the erratic warlord is a remarkable performance, as is the sinister turn from Rebecca Ferguson. Fellow showstoppers include the aforementioned terrifying Butler, the devout extremist from Javier Bardem and Zendaya's uncertainty with her place in the future.Being essentially the second and third acts of the novel, Part Two is naturally more action oriented than the first entry. In that regard they feel very different to each other, but both feel equally necessary in their respective executions. Part One's meticulous world-building and character set-up is expertly paid off throughout Part Two and feels intensely rewarding. Parallels to Lawrence of Arabia can be seen everywhere from both a story perspective and in the epic scale of the desert, but this is one of the very few films to achieve that same level of awe and wonder at every step of the journey.A cinematic phenomenon in every sense of the word. A cautionary tale on idolisation. The corruption of morality in the face of absolute power. The escalation of warfare fueled by cultural belief.

I felt the scale of the world made it very hard to connect with any of the characters and at times I lost what was going on in the story to be honest.Reviews are of course all about personal taste and I'm very much only a casual Sci-Fi fan if that.From what I know about the book Dune is a meticulously detailed story which I think is exactly what Sci-Fi fans are looking for and the these two newer films are much the same.I am however happy to say that I enjoyed Part 2 far more than I did the first film. Perhaps seeing this one on the big screen helped as I watched the first one at home. I do however think that overall this is a better and more accessible film. Being that I didn't enjoy the first film I couldn't remember all that much about it but I never felt lost with where the story was at any point this time around. I certainly wouldn't say it's my favourite film of all time or give it a 10/10 or anything like that but I was pleasantly surprised with how much more I enjoyed it compared to the first.As with the first film there's a lot going on, I would almost compare the story to the size and scale of Game of Thrones. There's a planet with various groups of inhabitants who are separated largely by their beliefs who all want power over the world. Each group has their own reason for wanting power, some for just-causes in order to create a more equal society (Fremen) and some who just want to be in control of the resources (Harkonnen). This causes conflict and so in steps are hero Paul Atreides (Timothee Chalamet) who has the power to see future events and keeps being told that he is meant to be a kind of Messiah to the Fremen who he intends to fight for but doesn't yet see himself as a leader of. That's a very simple way of putting it but I fear to say anymore would go into spoiler territory.The thing I enjoyed most was without doubt the cinematography, I just couldn't help but be engrossed in this world even if at times I wasn't as interested in the characters, the visuals alone always kept me from getting bored. Cinematographer Greg Fraser has done an outstanding job and I'll be very surprised if I see a better looking film this year if nothing else.A twice as good sequel that's well worth the price of admission to see it on the biggest screen possible.", "rating": 7, "sentiment": 1, "date": "6 March 2024", "name": "TomTalksFilms"}

This sequel continues to unravel the intricate tapestry of Frank Herbert's universe, achieving a complexity in narrative that is both commendable and ambitious. The performances are, without a doubt, stellar. Each actor brings depth and nuance to their character, enriching the sprawling narrative that spans across desolate landscapes and fervent political intrigue.The sound design and score are, once again, unparalleled. They not only enhance the visual experience but also immerse the audience into the vast, sandy expanses of Arrakis and beyond. The visuals are nothing short of breathtaking. Each frame is a meticulously crafted piece of art, showcasing the alien beauty of Herbert's universe with an attention to detail that is rarely seen in cinema today.Despite these remarkable achievements, the film is not without its flaws. The narrative, while complex and engaging, is encumbered by the sheer weight of its own mythology. At a runtime of 2 hours and 45 minutes, the film occasionally feels lengthy, and its pacing suffers as a result. The story's grand scale and numerous subplots, though richly woven, sometimes lead to a narrative density that can be overwhelming. This is most evident towards the film's climax, where the rapid succession of dramatic events and crucial plot points can feel somewhat jarring, as if emerging from the ether rather than the story's natural progression.This pacing issue could have been mitigated with a more balanced approach, perhaps by trimming certain scenes or redistributing the narrative focus. This would allow for a more even tempo and give the audience time to digest the complex developments without detracting from the story's immersive quality.In summary, \"Dune Part 2\" is a film that dazzles with its visual and auditory spectacle, carried by powerful performances and a deep, intricate storyline. It is a worthy continuation of the saga that will surely satisfy fans and newcomers alike, despite its pacing issues and the daunting complexity of its mythology. It stands as a reminder of the power of science fiction to challenge, captivate, and transport its audience to worlds beyond their wildest imagination.", "rating": 8, "sentiment": 1, "date": "3 March 2024", "name": "moritzmeyerautor"}

Denis Villeneuve, already a maestro of visual storytelling, elevates his craft to an echelon that few contemporaries dare to aspire towards. This sequel not only surpasses its predecessor but redefines the parameters of what science fiction can achieve.The narrative architecture of \"Dune: Part Two\" is both intricate and exquisite, weaving together the grand tapestry of Frank Herbert's universe with a meticulousness that is nothing short of breathtaking. Villeneuve's adaptation is not merely content with visual spectacle (though the film is replete with such moments); it is the emotional resonance, the palpable tension of the Atreides' saga that anchors the film. The director's ability to balance the macrocosm of interstellar politics with the microcosm of personal vendettas and alliances is a feat of narrative dexterity.The cinematography, courtesy of Greig Fraser, is a masterclass in visual poetry. Each frame is meticulously crafted, with the use of light and shadow not merely serving the aesthetic but deepening the thematic layers of the story. The landscapes of Arrakis are rendered with a stark beauty that is both alien and intimately familiar, a testament to the cinematographer's vision and skill.Hans Zimmer's score is, to put it simply, a revelation. The auditory landscape he constructs is as vast and complex as the visual one, with motifs and themes that echo the narrative's emotional beats. Zimmer's music does not just accompany the film; it elevates it, transforming scenes into symphonies of sight and sound.Performances across the board are stellar, with Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet's portrayal of Paul Atreides showing a maturity and depth that surpasses his earlier work. The supporting cast, including Zendaya, Javier Bardem, and Austin Butler, among others, bring gravitas and nuance to their roles, making the world of \"Dune\" feel lived-in and real.In conclusion, \"Dune: Part Two\" is not just a film; it is a monumental achievement in storytelling, visual art, and cinema. It challenges the viewer, not just to watch, but to immerse themselves in the rich tapestry of its universe. Villeneuve has not only created a sequel worthy of Herbert's legacy; he has crafted a masterpiece that stands as a beacon of what the future of filmmaking can aspire to be.

{"id": 810, "title": "A scienfic fiction masterpiece that blows the first movie out of the water", "content": "Science Fiction is a notoriously difficult genre to do well, and like Horror, can often be divisive with audiences. The first Dune was a great film, but common criticisms were that is was slow, dry and somewhat shallow. Dune: Part Two is none of these things. It is a truly spectacular movie-going experience that treats the source material with a great deal of reverence while also not being afraid to do its own thing. But what is perhaps this movie's greatest strength is that it treats it audience with some level of respect. It doesn't shy away from its sci-fi roots, and doesn't attempt to pad itself with unnecessary humour or sarcasm in an attempt to make itself more palatable. Dune 2 believes in itself, and its audience, and the end result is a gripping, beautiful, haunting film that will surely become a classic.The visuals, as usual, are spectacular. There are some sequences in this film that were so visually stunning that I am still thinking of them days after. The music, cinematography, set design, audio design and costuming are all on another level in this movie. Everything about it feels grandiose and sumptuous, and you can tell a great deal of care was taken to make this movie as beautiful as possible.Story and acting wise, Dune also impresses. While the movie does stray from the book and alter some plot points, the spirit of Dune and its message are prescient throughout. The middle of the movie does sag somewhat, and pacing issues may be one of my few criticisms of Dune: Part Two, but it's a minor issue that doesn't really effect the quality of the overall product too much. Timothee Chalamet shines here, and I was pleasantly surprised at just how believable he was as a dangerous Messiah-like figure. He sold the transformation incredibly well. Rebecca Ferguson is also at her best here, and my only complaint is that she isn't in the movie more.Other shining stars are Austin Butler, who is a magnificent choice for Fayd-Rautha, Javier Bardem as Stilgar, who provides some light brevity, and Charlotte Rampling who is fantastic as always. Florence Pugh, Lea Sideoux, Dave Bautista and Zendaya also give great performances. Christopher Walken is really showing his age in this movie, unfortunately, and I did feel that his portrayal of the Emperor lacked the gravitas that the role demanded.I highly recommend Dune: Part Two. It's an amazing film made with a great deal of care, and you can tell that Dennis truly respects and loves the source material he is adapting. I would recommend that you watch this movie in theatres, it's an amazing experience. If you can find a theatre with either IMAX or Dolby Atmos, you will have an amazing time.

However, with the almost 3 hour run time it is filled to the brim with great story, intense action, beautiful views, and great characters.

{"id": 818, "title": "\"Lead them to Paradise.\"", "content": "And every now and then something incredible is created that just simply blows you away.After almost a week of not understanding what I felt about this film at all I was finally granted peace on a second watch that answered all my questions. On my first watch I mainly left the cinema feeling nothing but confusion. Why didn't this blow me away as much as it did everyone else? After two and a half years of waiting, obsessing over the first entry, the world of Dune and counting down the days. After seeing how universally loved this second part was, after hearing every praise under the sun. Why didn't I get that? Would I just need to wait until the trilogy was finished? Would that experience rival that of watching Lord of the Rings? I wasn't even disappointed, I HAD just seen a fantastic film. I was just sad that I didn't get to have the experience I had so hoped for.And then today happened. I had convinced myself that a second watch would give me what I wanted, it would answer my almost spice induced dreams. And that's exactly what it did. Everything that was fantastic about the first film is then dialled to eleven; no, it's dialled to one hundred and eleven.Greig Fraser is an absolute master of cinematography. His ability to make every single frame look like a piece of art is simply beautiful. The world of Arrakis and Herbert's universe as a whole is perfectly encapsulated in visual perfection that I found myself lost in constantly. A true showcase of how to create the art of film.Hans Zimmer is nothing short of musical genius. The film's most clear source of power results from his score. The ethereal beauty of 'A Time of Quiet Between the Storms', the deep, soul-shaking strings that are scattered throughout that sent chills through me every time, 'Paul's Dream' which is simply iconic at this point. Zimmer has created pure brilliance through these films and somehow topped the perfection he'd already created.The cast all at the top of their game (well at least almost everyone), giving it their all to immerse us in this vast plethora of characters. The obvious standouts are Chalamet, Ferguson and Zendaya who all perform wonderfully in the lead roles delivering more complexity to the characters from their previous beginnings. However, Josh Brolin and Javier Bardem also bring some of the most memorable elements of the film through both the potentially unintentional humour and expertly delivered Fremen mannerisms of Stilgar and the subtle facial performance and determined warrior persona of Gurney. Austin Butler has to be mentioned though, bringing the psychotic mind and terrifying powerful aura of Feyd-Rautha to life fantastically. I can't help but feel a little disappointed with Christopher Walken's performance where his heart just didn't seem in it. The Emperor felt little more than an inconvenience despite his standing as ruler of this broken universe. Bautista as well, while he gave it a good go, just felt irritating and consistently uninteresting. However, these don't detract from the true talent displayed across this cast.The visual effects and production design working overtime to deliver this world to us in all its glory. The marvellously translated machinery of space travel, flight and spice harvesting. The intricate workings of Fremen technology. The grand scale, sheer power and frightening beauty of the Sandworms, the dark grittiness of the Harkonnens, the entire fantastical nature of this extraordinary universe.Villeneuve has adapted Frank Herbert's first novel in a phenomenally intense and glorious fashion that doesn't come around very often. What was thought to be \"unfilmable\" has blessed our screens once again. I'm not going to explicitly state that this is the greatest sci fi epic of all time because I don't want to go that far, but it could well be. Especially with the potential trilogy completion with Messiah. Again, the positively overwhelming cinematic experience that comes with this won't be replicable in the comfort of home, unfortunately. But, being able to experience it like this while we can is a gift enough.My opinion may change overtime and the previous doubt from my first watch, however delusional it may have been, indicates towards this. However, for now I am simply enamoured once again by the world of Dune and am ready to obsess over it again like I did those two and a half years ago. And this time I actually will complete my promise to read the books which have already been purchased finally.For something to take the filmic world by storm so thoroughly is a commendable achievement that doesn't come around very often. Even if one may find these films perhaps too slow or even too distant in its execution, it is merely impossible to not bask in the greatness of its technical merit. Outside of my own adoration, I cannot commend the entire cast and crew enough.It's difficult to describe how glad I am that I was able to experience this the way I had so hoped I could for so long and no matter what my thoughts may be in the future, this was truly a special experience. I could feel the power behind Lisan al Gaib as if I was a follower myself, the might behind Paul's words.I can't wait for what I hope will be the completion of this trilogy with Dune: Messiah as well as just being able to hopefully watch this again soon.We have all been set on the Golden Path and all we must do is follow it behind our Kwisatz Haderach amongst the stars into his holy war. Death and destruction may be left behind, but the divine universe will be alongside us all the way to watch its arresting elegance along the way to peace. As we take on this harrowing path in this cinematic duel, all that must be said is:\"May thy knife chip and shatter\".", "rating": 10, "sentiment": 1, "date": "9 March 2024", "name": "jswtw"}

I a faithful believer in Frank's books Herbert but I'm also a believer in Timothee Chalamet and the infamous Austin butler who gives such a scary and terrifying performance throughout the movie that he tramples Sting's performance in David Lynch's work.Jessica chesstein, Florence pug, Stellan Sk\u00e5rsgard and aother actors have managed to show that in this film everyone can shine at any moment in the entire Arraquis desert, but if you made me say who it was that completely stole the show it would have to be Austin Butler with his terrifying presentation and also the fun moments I was able to have with Javier Bardem.The film not only continues to leave us with the most important themes it has, such as politics in the Imperial World of Dune, including religious themes, ecological environmental themes, but it also even handles a somehow spiritual something symbolic something where you are in a desert, you feel that connecting with another essence of life and that is what I perceive when see the Dune part 2, an essence of life so great at an unimaginable magnitude that it causes anyone who immerses themselves in the desert to become become a Fremen.At the end of the day Dune part two will become an important film in the history of cinema either how to make a blockbuster of high magnitude or how to present a good cast, I have a lot of evidence and I can guarantee that I have zero doubts.

Having read Frank Herbert's Dune hexalogy, I have confidence that Denis Villeneuve could continue on and make entertaining interpretations of both Dune Messiah and Children of Dune. What I really, really, really can't wait to see, of course, and I think we can all agree on this critical point, is what would Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet look like when we get to God Emperor of Dune and he has become a giant, um, well, just look at some of the paperback covers.Dune: Part Two is a visual feast and sm\u00f6rg\u00e5sbord. Even the dunes look pretty. The massive crowds at Arrakeen are a bit whatever, the on-screen chemistry between Chani and Paul is reminiscent of Anakin and Padm\u00e9 tossing each other cringe-tastic love lines, the pace plods along slower than a spice harvester until the last 30 minutes, and Paul's transformation is not rizz.But Rebecca Ferguson is great, as is Javier Bardem and Christopher Walken. Dune: Part Two does a far better job of depicting plot movements than Dune: Part One, and also a decent job explaining how the different political factions are perpetually conniving and angling for more power, more spice.There are a handful of differences between the novel and Dune: Part Two, which I suppose were made for logical reasons.

The action, the battles, the love story... all of this continues through the film, but as it progresses it subtly turns, leading us to some bigger, and heavier themes such as the pointlessness of war, the dangers of religious fanaticism, fascism, and the questions of people who find themselves swept up in political madness.

Why, if there are rifles/laser weapons are the majority of the battles found hand to hand with swords? Especially when protecting the valuable Spice depot on Arrakis. It seemed like a really illogical move and a terrible military tactic. I felt like it was done more for the visual \"spectacle\" of having hand to hand fighting but it didn't make sense in universe.2.

This brings me on to my point about them \"riding\" the worms as they seemingly have little control apart from nominal left and right movement. You never see them stopping the worms and dismounting. The worms never seem to stop so you would likely have to leap off, almost certainly to your death.Linked into this there were scenes where there was a whole caravan of people including Lady Jessica in a Fremen style Sedan chair, how the hell did they all safely mount the worm and remain tethered and again how did they all dismount?Lastly there was the horrible dirge of Hans Zimmer's \"score\".

It was my third time seeing part one on the big screen, and just as delightful as before. Denis Villeneuve has created some of my all-time favorite movies - 'Prisoners' and 'Sicario', so I knew I was in for a treat once again. Grand scale science-fiction that is done 'right', usually gets me hyped out of the wazoo. I'm happy to say this one had me constantly on the edge of my seat as well.The visuals and lore of the Dune universe that Denis has transformed into film is magnificently breathtaking but most importantly of all; unique. The Harkonnen homeworld 'Giedi Prime' is by far one of my favorite planet designs (black/white light, brutalist architecture, the violent nature of its people) ever. The arena scene and introductory moment for na-Baron Feyd-Rautha got my blood pumping like a thumper.Just like in my previous review for 'Dune: Part One', Rebecca Ferguson is one of my standouts once again. In comparison to last chapter in which she felt rather afraid and unsure, she now completely transformed into a whole different person who, to be quite frank, is terrifying. Her screen presence is absolutely captivating and mesmerizing.In a movie with so many A-tier names, it is difficult to pick a favorite. Though, I think Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet's\n'Paul Muad'dib Atreides' might just be it. I wasn't fully convinced last film, but his monologue in the South and the way he portrayed Paul's transformation into the Messiah he himself fears, was brilliant. The baron, played by Stellan Skarsg\u00e5rd, will forever be - despite his little screentime - one of my favorite villainous characters in science-fiction.Hans Zimmer blew me away with the score for this film, more than the last. I'm a sucker for fast-paced soundtrack, and the more frequent and high-stakes action sequences in this second part allowed for Hans Zimmer to play into that with his music. The track that comes on when the Fremen ride into battle on sandworms against the Emperor's Sardauker army, is exhilarating and extremely powerful. This living legend has mastered his craft for sure.My only reason for this film not being a straight ten-star, is the ending. I cannot judge on the accuracy between the film and the novels, since I haven't read them, but the ending left me feeling slightly hung and yearning for more. I'm not sure if I just experienced a cliffhanger that will be further explored in a third chapter, or a brutal open ending.

{"id": 837, "title": "Dune: Part Two - A Cinematic Triumph", "content": "A visceral spectacle that transcends the boundaries of filmmaking, Dune: Part Two solidifies its place as a landmark achievement in cinematic history. Director Denis Villeneuve masterfully crafts a sequel that surpasses even its critically acclaimed predecessor, delivering a deeply affecting and visually stunning experience that will leave audiences awestruck.Picking up seamlessly from the events of the first film, Paul Atreides (Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet) finds himself grappling with the weight of his destiny. Haunted by visions of a potential future ravaged by war, he embarks on a perilous journey to prevent this horrific fate from unfolding. This journey leads him deeper into the desert planet of Arrakis, where he forms a closer bond with Chani (Zendaya) and the Fremen tribe, embracing their culture and harnessing their unique abilities.Villeneuve's vision for Arrakis is brought to life with breathtaking detail. The vast sand seas are both awe-inspiring and unforgiving, while the brutalist architecture of the Harkonnen cityscapes exudes a menacing grandeur. Every frame is meticulously composed, utilizing a masterful blend of practical effects and CGI to create a world that feels both alien and strangely familiar.The performances are uniformly outstanding. Chalamet delivers a powerful and nuanced portrayal of Paul, capturing both the vulnerability and determination of a young man wrestling with immense responsibility. Zendaya shines as Chani, imbuing the character with strength, intelligence, and a deep connection to her Fremen heritage. The supporting cast is equally impressive, with Rebecca Ferguson, Javier Bardem, Josh Brolin, and Stellan Skarsg\u00e5rd delivering memorable performances that add depth and complexity to the narrative.Beyond the visuals and acting, Dune: Part Two excels in its thematic exploration. The film delves into complex questions of power, destiny, and the consequences of choice. It grapples with the cyclical nature of violence and the potential for hope amidst seemingly insurmountable obstacles. This depth, combined with the film's operatic scope, elevates it from a mere sci-fi spectacle to a powerful and thought-provoking cinematic experience.While the film does require prior knowledge of the first film or the source material to fully appreciate its nuances, it stands as a remarkable achievement in its own right. The narrative, while dense in world-building and character development, unfolds with a captivating pace, leaving audiences engrossed throughout the film's near three-hour runtime.In conclusion, Dune: Part Two is not simply a great science fiction film; it is a cinematic masterpiece. It is a testament to the power of visionary filmmaking, captivating storytelling, and exceptional performances.This is a film that deserves to be seen on the biggest screen possible, preferably with an immersive sound system. It is a true spectacle in every sense of the word, and an experience that will stay with you long after the credits roll.", "rating": 10, "sentiment": 1, "date": "2 March 2024", "name": "hamimabdullah-19520"}

Dune is the epic masterpiece of our generation which you can see spectacular performances by incredible talented actors.

Denis Villeneuve is one of my favorite director and Greig Fraser did an amazing job as cinematographer which should be appreciated. And Hans Zimmer... If Hans Zimmer is composer of a film, it means that I will watch that movie at least for the music. I got goosebumps, various feelings which was great experience in cinema. The scripts and story which is based on phenomenal book makes me more excited as it seems it is an example of pure sci/fi genre movie but you can also see philosophical, religious, psychological points. I would like to see more epic battle and fight scene especially when Gurney take a revenge or Paul and his favorite cousin fight. It is impossible to put everything on a film because it is a huge universe but editing would be better in this point. If you have a chance, try to experience this stunning movie as possible as on the big screen.

A pity since Dune 1 was 10/10.", "content": "As unique and intriguing sci-fi Dune 1 was (10/10), Dune 2 was unfortunately a disappointment. It felt like a cheap copy of Dune 1. Dune 2 has shiny pictures, big actor names, yet no actual content.There was almost nothing new, just a repetition of what we saw in Dune 1. The world, the story and the characters felt smaller. Seeing the same things (characters' actions, interactions, sceneries) again and again just made it boring. In the middle of the film I thought, I could leave right now and wouldn't care how the film ends. Did it have to be so long? There were a lot of insignificant scenes unrelated to each other that were too long (oh man and slow motion didn't help with that), while others related to character development were too short. It ended and not much of a story or character progress was made and nothing had stood out in my mind. Such a pity.So many characters were badly developed. At one moment you see two characters still being in the same state they were in Dune 1 and at the next one they're deeply in love.Why did they turn Bardem's character, a mysterious, strong and interesting character from Dune 1, into comic relief? Did we really need that?(Too) late in the film we get introduced to Elvis, um sorry a bad guy - a totally generic character - and then we spend an oddly large amount of time just in the bad guy's world, where it feels as if a different film started in the middle of the actual one. Did they just randomly want to pay homage to \"Gladiator\"? Only Russell Crowe was missing from that scene sequence!Lastly, they chose popular actors for small roles and cameos for no good reason. Was it for the hype? Christopher Walken's acting abilities were wasted. What did e.g. Taylor-Joy (The Queen's Gambit), Pugh (Oppenheimer) or Seydoux (No time to Die) bring to the table? Poor Seydoux, an actor I like, all her character's scenes were ridiculous, with the culmination being ******SPOILER****** her touching her belly after an implied sex scene and saying \"The bloodline is secured.\"...

There is just so much to digest with this movie, the plot and character development is on spot in every scene. Easily had some of the best acting from the lead characters and did an amazing job making the audience wanting more from every person.

{"id": 841, "title": "Cinema worthy", "content": "The first Dune movie I had mixed feelings, since it felt too much like setting up pieces rather than a satisfactory story. Even if you're building a trilogy every movie should stand on it's own feet. Without ever having read the books I understand now why it is so difficult to capture them on film. Although we get a lot of story to chew here, certain characters feel still underdeveloped. To be fair I liked Part Two much more since we finally get some pay-offs from the first part. But then in the last act we get the same clunky set-ups we got in part one unfortunately. I must stress out that I enjoyed the movie quite a bit and I urge anybody to see it in cinema because it is an achievement and a sight to behold. Dennis Villeneuve and his team are masters at their craft: cinematography, editing, production design, sound & music are performing on the highest level here. It's truly rare to see this kind of united quality on a big screen, and it deserves to be up in the ranks of the biggest blockbusters. Everybody who loves going to the cinema to be immersed in another time and space should check it out. I might watch it again, just because I enjoyed it purely on a visceral level. The movie is almost three hours long but it passes by much quicker due to the great narrative flow. What I had problems with, although sounding nitpicky, is that there are so many players, that we don't get to know them very well and some important ones are dispatched of too quickly, sort of anti-climatic. Especially the ending felt kind of rushed to me. In general, but especially in the final battle I expected more losses or opposition in the fight. It almost felt too easy, no struggle. Again, this would have been great as a mini series, especially when it comes to fleshing out the antagonists. But on the other hand Vileneuve would have not gotten the budget for the location shoots, cinematography, sfx and everything else that made this so impressive if he had to operate on a streaming budget. I wished Villeneuve would release all the deleted scenes (of there are any) of this and turn it retroactively into a mini series, but since we all know his stance towards deleted scenes we know this is not going to happen. As it stands, I still enjoyed the hell out of this movie. It should be seen not only because of the immersive world and ambitious storytelling. But also to signal the big studios that audiences are tired of spectacle movies. And that they need to get their story departments in check, try to win audiences back with compelling stories rather than dangling shiny things in front of kittens.", "rating": 8, "sentiment": 1, "date": "29 February 2024", "name": "alex_with_a_P"}

However, nothing can compare to the visual and auditory spectacle that Dune parts 1 and 2 present.Lynch's adaptation took liberties, such as introducing the sound weapon, but it maintained a closer adherence to the overall storyline and atmosphere of the books. Perhaps my nostalgia plays a role here, as I first experienced it in the theatre upon its release.Some scenes require a certain level of visceral (yet functional) gore to remain faithful to the story, and Villeneuve's version seems to lack that element.", "rating": 8, "sentiment": 1, "date": "29 February 2024", "name": "master_g-78317"}

You should see this film on the biggest screen you can with the best sound system you can. Denis deserves a lot of credit for holding the reins here and delivering a film that is not only grand in scale but also grand in terms of its themes and messages. Whether it's the huge epic battle sequences we see, or the intense hand to hand combat scenes with Feyd, the film was gripping in all its action scenes\n3) Hans Zimmer truly brings his A game and the score for this film will be hard to beat when the Oscars come back around next year. He is an epic composer and this is a truly epic musical achievement\n4) For a film only just under three hours long, I thought it flew over. I checked my watch once just in passing and couldn't believe that 2 hours had passed already, which is a great sign because usually I say that films should be shorterNEGATIVES:1) I mentioned that I thought the performances were \"almost all\" great. The one exception to that for me was Dave Bautista. I really like him as an actor and usually think he performs great, but here I just felt that the performance was very one dimensional. I'm pretty sure he yells every single line of dialogue he has and it just got irritating after a while\n2) The first hour of the film was a bit of a slog for me, because it focuses almost exclusively on just meandering around with the Fremen. In fact, I found the Fremen sections of the film to be by far the weakest part. Whenever the Harkonnens or the Bene Gesserit were on screen I was loving it, but the scenes exploring Fremen culture and their religious beliefs were just a bit unnecessary for me because there are soooo many of them.

The desert landscapes, brought to life with a breathtaking combination of practical effects and cutting-edge CGI, transport the audience to the heart of Arrakis, immersing them in the rich tapestry of Herbert's universe.The narrative complexity of Dune Part Two is a testament to the filmmakers' commitment to intellectual stimulation. Layers of political intrigue, familial drama, and philosophical exploration interweave seamlessly, challenging the audience to engage on a profound level. This isn't merely a film; it's an odyssey through the complexities of power, destiny, and human nature.The ensemble cast, led by Timothy Chalamet's compelling performance as Paul Atreides, brings gravitas to each character. Their nuanced portrayals add depth and authenticity, making the fictional universe remarkably relatable. Hans Zimmer's evocative score is the sonic heartbeat that enhances every emotion, driving the narrative forward with a relentless intensity.Dune Part Two doesn't merely entertain; it provokes thought and lingers in the mind long after the credits roll.

All that was gone now and you couldn't care less for the character.If you are in for constant cgi action with poor fighting choreography, you'll probably enjoy this one, but if you're looking some depth and an actual movie instead of theme park ride, probably better to skip this one.\n                \n                    7 out of 25 found this helpful.\n                        \n                            Was this review helpful?

Denis Villeneuve does not waste the screen at all. Denis with Jon Spaihts and Frank Herbert writing, dialogue is sharp and really to the point, quite lean considering the mighty book it comes from, this is very good indeed.The sheer beautiful landscapes you could sit down and enjoy endlessly, the photography and camera tricks are some of the best in years, stark use of shades and colour in key scenes really do help the enjoyment for the film, along with the tight script and top acting. Everyone is good, really, really quite brilliant. Austin Butler must of had such fun with his role as he goes all out and is totally unrecognizable from real life. I could go on about everyone else, but that is not needed,This part has a lot more action going for it since most of the cast we are familiar with, but still there is lots of good conversing, humour is nicely put in that helps the mood. Just felt a tiny bit long, but long that it bores you, so a second watch is due.

Hard not to see as well Tarantino's influence in the treatment of violence.There is some urban film noir esthetic going on, some religious crowds on messianic worship vibes, and even classic Greek theater - the tragedies, of course, after all Herbert's main characters are the Atreides - with the Bene Gesserit women as coryph\u00e9e, but also graphic novels and bande dessin\u00e9e (Canada and France have produced marvellous work in that area, no wonder Villeneuve takes that route), including, surprisingly, a nod to Saint-Exupery's Le Petit Prince, as I cannot unsee the visual similarities between Paul/Chalamet and le Petit Prince on top of those dunes, under the sun, his unruly hair and scarf dancing in the wind.I love it.

Too poor right now or ever to leave the country! I haven't watched the other Dune movies. And haven't read the Dune books. I'm also shallow. I don't watch horror because the monsters are ugly and I don't want to look at it. But, I can read horror books. No visuals. If I were to write a horror screenplay. I'd write a beautiful monster.Okay my review:I watched a Brazilian soap opera called O Clone. Many of the main characters in that soap were Muslim. They were beautiful. Especially when not in public, because, hello modesty! So, I can understand Muslims and different ethnicities such as the Arabs, Persians, Urdu, Igbo, etc can be beautiful people with beautiful costumes and customs and buildings. At least in a Brazilian soap opera!!Why do I bring this up?Well, I'm glad you asked!This Dune movie seems to be a Muslim knock off.I may be an American bumkin who hasn't left the country but, I have heard Arabic, I have heard of the words Makdi and Jin and know what they mean. I know how religious people dress.This movie copied it all!! Along with other Muslim references.And I'm sorry to be so simple and shallow. But this movie has ugly protagonists people in sad, ugly outfits. They have ugly villain people in sad, ugly outfits.They have ugly buildings. They have ugly sand dunes. An ugly dessert.Even annoying background classical music the whole time. I'm not sure what kind of classical music that is. Too dramatic what ever it is.I mean the cinematography is impressive and I get how someone can think it's classy looking for that reason.I mean the movie is too much of a Muslim copying knock off and so it's hard for me to get over that. It just makes it too uncreative. And, I don't know if I'd be offended if I were Muslim or not. But, in my Brazilian Soap Opera there was more respect for them and humanity in them. A picture of a people with a life and a soul and a rich culture was shown.Visually, and culturally it's offensive. But, not only that, the copying of the plot religious wise is offensive too!! I mean the plot makes too many references to religious prophecies and predictions and it's offensive because it's just not right to exploit something holy like that. Not just prophecies but even prayer customs.And these fake Muslims are at war with another people. And their holy war and struggles in this movie seems really offensive to me too. I mean, they are making cinema and entertainment of the struggles of middle easterners and Africans? I don't know how to think of this.This movie tries to act emotional and show their struggles but it seems to make everyone a caricature rather than a real people with a soul and life.The movie is really a one note plot too. It's like overly milking the lead up to war and figuring out all that.I don't understand why they have so many sword fights in advanced technology societies.They show sand. And underground tunnels or rooms? I'm not even sure. I need a map. I wish the movie showed architecture or cities or something. I just saw and scenes with a lot of people. Not able to gain a sense of what this world is.Well anyway, dramatic music, cinematography and serious war conversations aside, it's hard for me to take this movie seriously because of everything that I mentioned.This movie has high reviews because it seems people are simps for high, intense, over drama cinamentography and over the top emotional war drama it seems.And it's forever long.

I haven't read the book, but watched David Lynch's version back in the 80s and understood this just fine. Mind you, I have read Jodorowsky's Dune-influenced Incal, so this was nothing to that level of bizarre and fantastical. My concern was the ridiculous length. It seemed like the countless Netflix movies, where they think that playing two piano chords in a long drawn out way and showing characters blankly pondering emotions, makes it a Scandinavian masterpiece.Dune Part Two just took too long to do very little. Considering the book is considered unfilmable, I expected there to be too many concepts and plot lines crammed in. But instead watched three hours of drawn out, ponderous scenes, attempting to be a hallucinogenic trip but not having the conviction to commit to it.It was undeniably magnificently shot, scored and choreographed. The sound design was incredible. I enjoyed looking and listening to it, especially the unique action scenes. But dialogue was often very trite and too on the nose. The vehicles were still good, but lacked the visual impact of Part One. And characters were given disappointingly anti-climactic payoffs.This was a top end 12 as well. Very graphic and uncomfortable in many places. Beware taking sensitive kids to see this.I enjoyed Part One (I gave that 7 stars), but was more wowed by the spectacle than the acting or plot. I love Denis Villenuve's work, but Lynch was a closer match to the source material. This instalment lacked the impetus of the first, and therefore flapped pretentiously about as a placeholder between part one and three. It lacks the wonderful weirdness of Frank Herbert's world-especially in the very poorly cast emperor (love the actor, but out place here), Jodorowsky had cast Salvador Dal\u00ed, and somehow that tells you all you need to know.I'm not afraid of a long film, or an arthouse film.

{"id": 866, "title": "Perspective from a lifelong Dune fan", "content": "This is a long review. So, thanks in advance for reading. Even if no one ever reads this I need to get the thoughts out of my head.I will give my background hopefully to inform the perspective of my review.Dune is my favorite book, and I re-read it every other year or so and have done for the past 30+ years. The quality declines quickly after the first book, but the first book is a masterpiece. It is the best singular work of fiction in my opinion. Every time I read it; I discover something new.In addition, I am a huge fan on the '84 Dune. I understand this seems to be a divisive comment for many. And I find that sad that people can't just tolerate that others have different tastes.I have consumed any new adaptation of Dune, whether it be TV series or movie. The '21 Dune was something that just didn't click for me. I understand there were some production constraints due to the pandemic which made the editing difficult if not impossible, and in my opinion there were some critical errors made in casting. I say that because although I was excited for Dune Part Two my expectations were certainly measured.Denis Villeneuve (and his production team) are the great cinematographers & art directors of our time. The images Denis puts to screen are magnificent. However just because you frame a beautiful scene does not necessarily mean you have created an engaging screenplay. And I think the area where his Dune adaptations fall short of being perfect 10/10 is in the misfires in casting.The '84 Dune exceeds the adaption in casting in ALMOST every way. Timothee, Zendaya, Momoa, Walken, Bautista, Brolin. These are actors who I enjoy greatly. But they are cast in these movies based upon looking a certain way. They are not great fits for the roles. Yet, Dune Part Two succeeds in spite of this. I honestly don't see how you can try to argue the casting. You want to tell me that Jason Momoa is a better Ducan Idaho than Richard Jordan? Chris Walken. I mean I love the guy. But it's a very odd choice for Emperor. I think the movie succeeds IN SPITE of Timothee and Zendaya not being particularly strong leads. I love DRAX, best comic relief sidekick ever. But lets be honest Bautista's dramatic acting chops are not top tier. There were of course a few upgrades. Rebecca Ferguson & Florence Pugh were excellent. I don't think Javier Bardem was great as Stilgar in Part One, but in Part Two he absolutely carried the movie. His performance blew me away. It gave the movie heart.The screenplay of Dune Part Two was a great improvement over part one. It was exceptionally true to the books. Other than the exclusion of the Guild Navigators (that was disappointing). The screenplay brilliantly captured the messiah elements. The only critique I would make is that the Geidi Prime scenes (which was a surreal detour into German expressionism) consumed too much run time which caused the climax and last act to feel rushed and unearned. There was a decision to feature Feyd (feels like a Hollywood $ decision) much more than in the book, and this takes away from other elements in the movie. Alia (The Knife) Atreides was excellent. The way they presented her character was brilliant. ATJ was Alia. Well, that's genius.Great day I bet you are thinking. Did you even like the movie? YES.The movie was exceptional.It moved me emotionally many times. The scene where Paul rides the grandfather worm moved me to tears. The pacing for a long movie was excellent. The effects were incredible. Sound design incredible. Art direction incredible. Score incredible.Dune Part Two was an improvement upon Dune Part One. And I think its fair to say that's a consensus.I hope this movie makes a lot of money and I intend to see it a few more times in cinema. Despite its shortcomings in casting (which you may or may not agree with) it is a brilliant piece of cinema.

I mean, I do think this is a pretty great movie but only as good as the first part. While it does some things in the narrative more focused, that's mostly because those were just getting set up in the first part. The pacing is pretty off here and the way most of the action scenes are not really given more importance than simple narrative formula, it still felt unfinished at the end. It didn't really use the villains much either as it was all set-ups that felt anti-climatic. But even with all those problems, it was still effective in showcasing the evil that can rise from fundamentalism. The way Javier Bardem's lines were funny throughout the movie is also a reminder of how evil can spread through righteousness and earnestness when you are forced to be blinded by indoctrination that uses their rightful hatred. I really do hope the next part Messiah is still made, since this still feels very unfinished.\n                \n                    1 out of 7 found this helpful.\n                        \n                            Was this review helpful?

{"id": 873, "title": "A Transportive Cinematic Experience", "content": "'Dune: Part Two' picks up directly where the first left off, with Paul Atreides and his mother, Lady Jessica, still on the run after the surprise attack on House Atreides by the brutal Harkonnens. Now allied with the Fremen of Arrakis, the two survivors must learn the natives' ways if they are to survive the desert planet's harsh conditions. That will not be their only challenge, though, as the threat of House Harkonnen remains and Paul's destiny approaches...For me, the most interesting aspect of 'Dune' is its mythology and lore, which combines classic sci-fi elements with a surprising amount of religious undertones. 'Part Two' dives deeper into the prophecies that foretell the coming of the Kwisatz Haderach, a messianic figure who is destined to free the Fremen from the oppression of offworlders and lead humanity to a better future. Some believe Paul to be this savior, while others insist the prophecies are nothing more than stories meant to further enslave the Fremen by instilling false hope. This creates a compelling clash of ideologies, represented by Stilgar's faith in his beliefs versus Chani's devotion to her people, with both sides having valid arguments. Even Paul himself sometimes struggles with the massive expectations thrust upon him by the believers. However, he's not above using them to his advantage by means of manipulation, giving him a layer of complexity not seen in most typical \"heroes\".The characters, and the actors who portray them, are another of the film's highlights. Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet brings a new intensity to the role of Paul Atreides not seen in 'Part One', further cementing him as one of the finest young performers of our generation. Rebecca Ferguson (Lady Jessica) does the same, along with something else I certainly wasn't expecting: straight-up freakiness. Nearly everyone in the cast is great, save for Christopher Walken who feels... out of place as the Emperor. The film's MVP, though, is easily Austin Butler's Feyd-Rautha Harkonnen, who delivers an absolutely spine-chilling performance akin to Heath Ledger's Joker and Javier Bardem's Anton Chigurh.Some may claim 'Dune: Part Two's greatest strengths lie in its technical elements, which serve to elevate the film even higher. Its cinematography, production design, sound, and visual effects work in tandem to stimulate the senses and create one of the most transportive cinematic experiences I've had. From the first scene on the sands of Arrakis my eyes were wide open and glued to the screen. Unfortunately, I found the climax of the film to be underwhelming. It begins in epic fashion yet ends quite abruptly shortly after, which is especially disappointing given how well the filmmakers lay the groundwork for the conflict over the course of both movies. It's still an enjoyable sequence but ultimately felt anticlimactic after all the buildup.Although 'Dune: Part Two' may not fully live up to the hype, in my book, I absolutely do not regret spending my time and money on it. The film takes everything I enjoyed about its predecessor and builds upon it in (mostly) satisfying ways while introducing intriguing new layers to the characters and mythology. Just do yourself a favor and see it on the biggest screen possible, because this is the kind of movie made for the theatrical experience. I can now safely say that the 'Dune' franchise has me hooked, and with the promise of a third installment on the way, I eagerly await my next adventure to Arrakis.", "rating": 8, "sentiment": 1, "date": "5 March 2024", "name": "vinniec-53536"}

{"id": 880, "title": "A sci-fi masterpiece", "content": "WARNING! The following review will have spoilers from DUNE: PART ONE. You have been WARNED! Canadian director Denis Villeneuve is currently doing the impossible: faithfully adapting author Frank Herbert's sci-fi epic, Dune. While DUNE: PART ONE focused on establishing its characters, its massive world, and the power structures within that world, DUNE: PART TWO lets go of the reins and watches what naturally happens. After the downfall of House Atraides at the hands of the ruthless House Harkonnen, Paul Atraides (Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet) and his mother Lady Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson) are in hiding among the Fremen people on the desert planet of Arrakis. Paul is trying to balance a lot in his head. Revenge for his father, helping the Fremen with their ongoing war with the Harkonnen, and denying the faithful Bene Gesserit, who believe in a prophecy involving him. Chalamet does a great job in portraying the growth of his character, sometimes forcing the audience to question themselves. His love interest is Chani (Zendaya), a Fremen warrior who is drawn to who he is, instead of his power. While PART ONE was about fear, PART TWO is about power, and the dangers of it. The story gets deep and complex. The technical aspects of this movie are stellar. The visuals, production design, and cinematography are some of the best I've seen. The scenes with the Harkonnens were filmed using infrared cameras, making them look black and white, while keeping the cold, metallic, savage look of the people. As you might be able to tell, I thought DUNE: PART TWO is a sci-fi masterpiece. The best part about it are the small details of the world Denis has created. From the Fremen language, the mechanized vehicles, and the contrasting cultures. Even the large-scale shots make this feel like a one-of-a-kind theater-going experience. This is why I love going to the theater so much. While watching this, I kept thinking that this must've been what it felt like watching EMPIRE STRIKES BACK, or THE LORD OF THE RINGS: THE TWO TOWERS on the big screen. Previously fleshed out characters going to war against each other, with the potential of an even more epic final movie in the trilogy. Yes, this movie is THAT good.

It's a fantasy driven story with sci-fi elements sprinkled throughout. A sci-fi story is driven by consistency, here supernatural elements drive the story.It's played well enough, filmed well enough, long and boring at times and doesn't escape the inconsistencies of the book.We have the one, I mean another \"the one\" (TM, C, rehashed through and through) who, despite being built like a twig, manage to overcome anything placed in front of him (morpheus recognizes easily that he is the One and is ready to give his life for Zion). We have fremens, with some women built also like twigs who engage in fights with much bigger men while others cower in fear (how does this society work exactly?). In a time of space lasers shown prominently in the first scene of the first movie, everyone loves blades in this one unless they want nukes which miraculously have been hidden on the planet for time immemorial, really? And no one wondered why the nukes just happen to be relocated from their homeworld to this one and everyone forgot about them? The south storm business is funny for sure: don't think about it, just enjoy the spectacle.There's also sandworms who behave as intended for the plot to move forward. Actually, lots of things just happen for the plot to move forward, even if it means that the characters have to behave inconsistently from a scene to the next.Speaking of the sandworms, and that's something that the filmmaker avoided at all cost, was to show how the riders dismounted the beasts because it made no sense whatsoever. The filmmaker kept the riding sequence because it's impressive: these are monsters eating sand and machinery for breakfast, rubbing themselves on rocks anytime of the day, and they are bothered by (and then driven like cattle), in comparison with their size, by what is like two pieces of dust on top of their skin?They can also capture baby sandworms but not perform basic biochemistry or chemistry to synthesize/farm spice at will? (I know the book was written in the 60s and biotechnology was not as developped, although penicilin was manufactured by fermentation already in WW2).The messianic and religious aspects are exhausting to the point where I started to root for the antagonists towards the end because the protagonists have literally no redeeming qualities.It's a spectacle to enjoy for sure, but don't pay attention to the story, it's nonsensical.", "rating": 3, "sentiment": 0, "date": "5 March 2024", "name": "KateM75"}

About two hours in, it feels done, but basically, sit back because you are about to watch another episode in the same franchise. Except for significantly toning down on gore to keep a lower rating, the movie is really faithful to the source books, even very quietly referencing the golden path.The movie is incredibly politically correct without being incredibly offensive which is a feat these days. Every aspect of the movie is as brutally mundane as it can be while being epic in scope. There is nothing that doesn't stand out, the music, the pacing, the costumes, the special effects. You can see everything clearly all the time, even in a sand storm or a high speed knife fight with shields.It's only real problem is the incredible depth of the story. Even reading the books it is difficult to understand it. There are perhaps 3 or 4 passages across the 5 books that finally explain the story. The more accessable they make the movie to the casual viewer, the less of the depth they can portray. Even with a 3 hour run time, some of the villains feel like you didn't get a chance to really know them.There are some small but significant deviations from the novels. Some merely made me raise an eyebrow. Others added more content to characters but one wandered into cliche territory. Finally, the new version of Alia's story was deeply distrubing and that made it fantastic. No previous version of Dune has presented the topic of abomination in such an uncomfortable way. The fact that the reverand mother did not seem completely in control, only added to this.Can you go see this movie without seeing the other two versions and reading the 28 novels?

Visually, the film transcends expectations; its use of color and composition is not merely beautiful but borders on genius, creating a vivid, immersive experience that enhances the narrative's emotional and thematic depth.However, despite these strengths, I find myself hesitating to award \"Dune 2\" a perfect score, a reservation I also held for Dune 1. The films' inability to stand entirely independent of one another, just throws me off. The anticipation for subsequent chapters is palpable throughout, leading to a sense of incompleteness. While anticipation can be a strength, in this instance, it borders on leaving the viewer in a constant state of waiting. This is a film, not a TV show.Yet, it's impossible to overlook the brilliance with which \"Dune 2\" explores the intricacies of human nature, intertwining it with elements of fantasy and what can only be described as 'scientific magic.' This blend feels like a not-very-far future that I will not be alive to see.The music, in concert with the film's visual and thematic elements, elevates the narrative, crafting an immersive experience that is both profound and emotionally resonant.

I think I must have missed something because I thought it was a let down, especially compared to the first film.I mean this one is completely over the top and not in a good way.After all the poster should have given it away, it looks so bad as if they had caught a desert stomach flu.The acting is mediocre at best, ridiculous at worst (Zendaya and her pouting , Timoth\u00e9e and his screaming). Only Javier Bardem was somewhat endearing and provided some comic relief (hopefully it was intentional).For someone who split the film into two parts to have enough time to tell the story properly it was extremely rushed. Where the first part really took the time to develop the plot this one just goes all over the place making it hard to follow and understand. Some things just don't make sense, and this time I'm not talking about the sand spice! What's with the sudden character changes out of the blue and don't get me started on the talking foetus!It's also extremely aggressive on the senses. The scene with Austin Butler in the arena was almost physically painful to watch with a mix of the loudest noise (mr Zimmer, it's not because you make it louder that the music suddenly becomes good) and weird colour way. I'm glad it didn't last too long.Overall I didn't spend a good time in front of that part.The best thing to come out of this film are all the memes about the Lisan Al-Gaib and the sand worm so I'm going to console myself with that at least.", "rating": 5, "sentiment": 1, "date": "7 March 2024", "name": "Persora"}
{"id": 892, "title": "Great", "content": "Denis Villeneuve's much-anticipated Dune Part 2 has finally graced the silver screen, and it does not disappoint. As the second installment in the adaptation of Frank Herbert's timeless masterpiece, this film not only lives up to the hype generated by its predecessor but surpasses expectations, solidifying its place as a cinematic triumph in the science fiction genre.The narrative of Dune Part 2 picks up seamlessly from where its predecessor left off, delving deeper into the intricate political web and interstellar conflicts that define the Dune universe. The film masterfully weaves together complex storylines, introducing new characters while further developing the arcs of familiar ones. Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet's portrayal of Paul Atreides continues to impress, as he navigates the challenges of leadership and his destiny as the Kwisatz Haderach. Chalamet's performance is nuanced and compelling, capturing the essence of Paul's internal struggles with both power and prophecy.One of the standout aspects of Dune Part 2 is its visual spectacle. Cinematographer Greig Fraser's breathtaking shots bring Herbert's vivid and expansive world to life, from the towering sand dunes of Arrakis to the opulent interiors of royal spaceships. The attention to detail in the production design, coupled with Hans Zimmer's haunting and atmospheric score, creates an immersive experience that transports the audience to the heart of the Dune universe. The film's visual effects are nothing short of groundbreaking, seamlessly integrating fantastical elements with the raw, desert landscapes of Arrakis.Villeneuve's directorial prowess is evident throughout Dune Part 2, maintaining a perfect balance between action sequences and moments of quiet introspection. The film is relentless in its pacing, keeping viewers on the edge of their seats while still allowing for emotional resonance. The intricate choreography of battle scenes is a testament to the filmmakers' commitment to authenticity and detail, making each confrontation a visceral and memorable experience.The ensemble cast of Dune Part 2 is nothing short of stellar. Zendaya's portrayal of Chani continues to captivate, bringing depth and strength to a character pivotal to the unfolding narrative. Oscar Isaac and Rebecca Ferguson, as Duke Leto Atreides and Lady Jessica, respectively, deliver powerful performances that add layers to the familial dynamics at the heart of the story. New additions to the cast, including Javier Bardem as Stilgar and Charlotte Rampling as Reverend Mother Gaius Helen Mohiam, seamlessly integrate into the established ensemble, enriching the film's tapestry with their own compelling characters.The thematic richness of Dune Part 2 is another highlight, exploring timeless concepts such as power, destiny, and the consequences of choices. The film delves into the complexities of politics, religion, and ecological sustainability, elevating it beyond a mere sci-fi spectacle to a thought-provoking exploration of human nature and society.One of the film's strengths lies in its willingness to embrace the ambiguity and complexity inherent in Herbert's source material. Dune Part 2 does not shy away from the moral gray areas of its characters or the intricate political machinations of the universe. This commitment to authenticity results in a narrative that is intellectually engaging, leaving ample room for interpretation and discussion.In conclusion, Dune Part 2 stands as a cinematic achievement that transcends the boundaries of its genre. Denis Villeneuve and his team have crafted a film that pays homage to Frank Herbert's legacy while pushing the boundaries of visual storytelling.", "rating": 10, "sentiment": 1, "date": "2 March 2024", "name": "LisaPiresLuxe"}

I question why some of those decisions were made, especially in regards to Chani's story. However in the context we are given in the movie, I assume they are pushing for a third, to see Chani and Maud Dib's story to full fruition.

Let's just say slow.In particular, everything scene with Zendaya gets a bit boring and uneventful and she just doesn't do anything for me, giving the only bad and unnatural performance (in general, of course she has a couple of nice line deliveries here and there).Having said that, the greater actors and characters are the ones giving us the most thrilling scenes and intrigues.

Crafted for the expansive expanse of IMAX with Dolby Atmos, this cinematic marvel delivers an unmatched immersive experience, scoring a commendable 9/10 rating from my viewpoint. Villeneuve's vision transports audiences to the majestic landscapes of Arrakis, enveloping them in a world of visual splendor and sonic depth that defies description.At the heart of this epic saga lies the flawless performances of its cast. Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet's portrayal is a revelation, his nuanced acting and impeccable line delivery infusing the narrative with emotional resonance and depth.

While it serves as a minor flaw, it tempers the film's otherwise impeccable execution.In conclusion, Dune: Part Two captivates audiences with its grandeur and storytelling prowess, a testament to Villeneuve's mastery of the craft.

{"id": 899, "title": "Visual masterpiece that lacks soul", "content": "Well, this really was a breathe of fresh air.In ocean of big, dumb, driven with awful CGI blockbusters that polluted the cinema over the last few years, it's pleasing to finally see something that's appealing to both eyes and ears. In visual department, \"Dune 2\" outdoes it's predecessor in every way (and that movie was already one of the most gorgeous movies ever made). The worms, the action scenes and the world of \"Dune\" feel grand without feeling overbearing and are accompanied by equally epic soundtrack. Villeneuve, Zimmer and whole visual department deserve infinite credit for their work here.Then there are performances. Timothy Chalamet completely destroyed my doubts by delivering a powerful performance as Paul the leader. This is definitely the guy that I would follow into the battle. Bardem and Fergusson are also excellent in their respective roles (although latter doesn't get nearly enough screen time that she should). Brolin doesn't appear much in the movie but he's still entertaining as always.Unfortunately, not all performances are great. Poor Zendaya really tries her best here, but it just doesn't work. She and Timothy have no chemistry and her acting just looks unnatural.Contrary to popular opinion, I absolutely dislike portrayal of Harkonens. Despite getting more screen time than in the previous movie but still feel flat and are not fleshed out. Skarsgard is still doing his impression of Brando from \"Apocalypse Now\" and completely lacks energy, charisma and determination that you'd expect a planet leader like him to have. Butler overacts way too much for me to take him seriously while Batista... Well, he is just Batista.The title of worst offender, however, goes to Christopher Walken who brings nothing interesting to the role of emperor. He just looks old, tired, confused and like that he doesn't want to be there, which is shocking knowing that Walken is a type who usually gives 110% in all of his roles.Another problem is pacing and story. While the first half is excellent, second half feels rushed. There's suddenly so many things happening at the same time and there's not nearly enough time to flesh any of that out. We also get some pointless storylines that just choke the movie and go nowhere, such as Chani acting like a contrarian for no reason whatsoever and completely pointless side plot in which Feyd impregnates Farring (who, by the way, is male in the book).Finally, there are changes from the book that damage the movie. I already mentioned changes in Chani's character and pointless gender swapping, but key characters such as Alia, Thufir Hawat and navigators are completely absent. OK, not completely, as Alia spends whole movie in her mother's womb, but she should have been there whole time and properly fleshed out, which is something they definitely had time for. The combination of all these factors contribute to a very anticlimactic climax in the end.And also - what's up with all those close-ups?That all said, this is still a movie worth watching. Most of the takes in this review are purely subjective so take them with grain of salt. I fully encourage everyone to go see this movie and make their own opinion. If nothing else, the visual and audial experience makes it worth watching.8/10.", "rating": 8, "sentiment": 1, "date": "2 March 2024", "name": "stamenkovickosta"}

Her rants are not credible and I think she was not good enough for the role.The harkonnen world was quite plain, without force, without creating horror or fear, just plain, color washing was not enough to portray Giedi Prime. Feyd battle in the arena was emotionless, and so so.I know the book in the book feels rushed but it hasnt to be that way in the movie. We could have enjoyed 15 minutes more in the final battle.

I did spend a little more cheddar to see it on the best screen which I do not regret.The movie does expect you to know something about what came before it but obviously I can't blame them.

These are the main character in a huge assemble cast and I could not have care less.Who did do something for me is Javier Bardem as Stiligar whose Morpheus from the Matrix-like belief in Paul was entertaining, Rebecca Ferguson as Paul's mom who I felt gave the best subtle but sinister performance of all the subtle but sinister performances in the movie and Austin Butler as Feyd-Rautha who stole the scene whenever he was on it.The third hour of the movie was where the story picked up how I wanted to but by then I was tired and wanted it to be over.

It is the quint essential \"show don't tell\" model on full display. It has such a natural flow and the editing is perfectly done as we are not jolted back and forth between story lines.The real question is how the general audience will respond to this film as it does not overly explain anything and can at times be confusing as to what is happening if one is not paying close attention.It is one film I really anticipate returning to theaters to experience for at least one more time, maybe 2!", "rating": 9, "sentiment": 1, "date": "1 March 2024", "name": "stevo-95752"}

The epic soundtrack by Hans Zimmer perfectly complements the cinematic experience, contributing to the grand atmosphere of the film.Denis Villeneuve demonstrates technical competence, reaching a level of excellence in the cinematic field. For science fiction enthusiasts, the film is an excellent piece to fill their time.However, my main criticism centers on the complex narrative, rich in details and characters, making it challenging for those unfamiliar with the Dune universe. Despite being initially engaging, the plot became confusing amidst intrigues and actions, leaving me lost. The final part of the film raised questions about the characters' motivations, hindering the clarity of the story.The nearly three-hour duration felt rushed in some scenes, reminiscent of the last season of \"Game of Thrones,\" where resolutions were quick, lacking time for reflection. Perhaps a slower approach, possibly divided into two parts, would have benefited the narrative.The character development was disappointing, as I couldn't establish emotional connections with them. Their fate became indifferent, and only Chani managed to evoke a slight emotional bond.The villains, especially Feyd-Rautha, seemed to have potential but were not portrayed as true threats.

The same stunning visuals of the desert and the worms are present once again. The sound is again superb. What steps up a level here are the themes broached which are unusually dark and complex for a \"Hollywood Blockbuster\". Fate, greed, ambition, the manipulation of faith, the need for people to follow, the lack of clear winners - the list goes on and on.Paul's character develops well from unlikely hero to credible hero to.....well something else, something darker. Why does he lead the galaxy to war when he knows billions will die needlessly? Does the power corrupt him or was this part of the necessary \"fine line\" he could see to save his people? It leaves the viewer with questions which probably leads to a welcome third movie. In fact the very brief cameo by Anya Taylor-Joy as Paul's future sister would suggest the 3rd movie is inevitable.The stars of the show though are the deeply sinister Bene Gesserit who are behind all the major moves in the film \"You of all people should know by now, there are no sides, Reverend Mother\" was such a beautiful answer to seemingly having backed the wrong horse.Some of my issue about the first movie was it felt at times a bit contrived. The only time I felt this in this one was the character of Feyd-Rautha. He wasn't a bad character but was he necessary? Firstly, not every film has to end in hand to hand combat. But secondly, if it did, didn't we already have Beast Rabban there who could have fulfilled that requirement? Anyway, small complaints.So overall an enjoyable sci-fi movie which brought more complex and darker views to the game than the traditional good v evil movies.

Every costume shows the ancient history which comes with the planet and characters.Set design was also outstanding.

A lot of ancient instruments are used (The Duduk, Zurnka etc.) and these instruments are made of wood and as the music of these instruments play a sense of history and the heavy future and past is felt just through music notes. It brings chills just listening to the score.Denise Villeneuve's world building in this movie is right out of the books. Sitting in the theatre you experience the movie because of the scale which is shown. The planet is breathtaking, the space-ships are futuristic, the sandworms are felt as if infront of you.

But the new cast adds something to the movie. Most surprising character was Feyd-Rautha and the way Austin Butler portrayed the psychotic beast that is described in the books, and he brought it to screen. It was so incredible seeing him take on this psycho role, especially after Elvis. Personally Stilgar and Feyd-Rautha might be my favourite characters in this sequel. Javier Bardem does an amazing job playing Stilgar seriously yet managing to sneak in a bit of comedy.Timothee Chalamet delivers a speach in Chakobsa (Fremen language) which is so powerful! It's so incredible seeing how the change of language can influence a scene. This specific scene truly shows how talanted Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet is.I really recommend watching this movie in IMAX since it was filmed specifically for IMAX.

Whilst slowly adjusting to the notion that he might actually be the one, he starts rallying the troops for a push against evil House Harkonnen whilst Jessica replaces the tribe's dying reverend mother. The vile Baron meanwhile (Stellan Skarsgard) is unhappy with nephew Rabban's (Dave Bautista) progress on Arrakis and brings on board younger and nastier nephew Feyt (Austin Butler).More complex than part 1 with a good solid balance between the action scenes which are very impressive to look at (see it on the biggest screen you can) and progressing the belief or not, both by Paul and various Fremen, including new love Chani (Zendaya) as to whether he may be the one. Everyone in it gives a good account of themselves, although I particularly liked Florence Pugh, providing regular exposition as the Emperor's (Christopher Walken) insightful daughter Irulan, Rebecca Ferguson again as Jessica and again Stellan Skarsgard, hypnotic as the disgusting emperor. Chalamet also deserves credit. Not only does he lead from the front in 90% of the film, but he convincingly morphs from young boy to strong adult leader by the end of the film - he even ends up looking different.

The convoluted storyline results in an ill-paced cinematic experience, where parts of the film's 3-hour runtime seem to drag for an eternity, whilst others are skimmed and skipped over. The film leaves too many questions unanswered, and despite its considerable runtime, many characters and plot lines are not afforded enough time to properly develop and shine.The likes of Austin Butler are wasted in this film, with a compelling and interesting character who ultimately has a total of 10 minutes screen time and is swiftly and predictably killed off.The likening of this film's \"epic battle sequence\" to The Lord of the Rings- or indeed any grand cinematic battle sequence of recent decades- is frankly insulting. If you are watching this film with the expectation that the battles will be a transformative cinematic experience, prepare to be disappointed by a 5-minute sequence that ends as swiftly as it begins. Countless more deserving films could be afforded this high praise.The film's present critical and audience reception is by far its biggest weakness, setting expectations that cannot and are not met. The bar needs to be lowered for this film to successfully impress. It's beautiful, and features a stacked cast, but it is not genre-defining, nor is it's script remotely noteworthy. If you are seeking a visual feast of a sci-fi film, the director offers many more impressive submissions.Chalamet fans who are craving a film with noteworthy action sequences that features the actor in a position of leadership and power are better off trying Netflix's \"The King\".

It is loud, incoherent and subtitles are added ad hoc when the noise is too high. Despite the interesting special effects and the extraordinary source material, Villeneuve's execution leaves much to be desired. Never mind the studio-planted endless ratings of 10/10 on this site.We forgave the sluggishness of Dune, but we are bewildered by Dune II. My rating of this film is low, because one must take into consideration not just the final product, but also the abundant resources available to Villeneuve to create this film: ample budget, talented cast, and a rich source material.The pacing of the first movie was rightfully criticized as slow. Unfortunately, this trend persists in Dune II. I found myself zoning out constantly despite the fact that I am an ardent fan! And that is where the problem lies. Villeneuve's emphasis is to appeal to younger viewers with limited familiarity with Frank Herbert's phenomenal books. Consequently, enthusiasts of Dune may depart the theatre shaking their heads in disappointment, and asking themselves, What the heck just happened? In addition to that, Villeneuve actually changes the original story of the novel which may leave avid fans of the novel feeling quite disappointed.Regrettably, the execution fell short of expectations. Directors, producers, with a lot less at their disposal have produced much better products. This movie has endless silhouettes against the sunset (ok, we get it) garbled dialogue, too many closeups, rushed script. I am not entirely surprised, I suppose. I began to worry when seeing the overwhelming hype surrounding this production, surpassing even that of Dune. The frequent interviews by the young actors delivering lame dialogue, coupled with long-winded monologues from the female lead, leave much to be desired in terms of refinement. It seems unlikely that an Oscar is forthcoming for this performance, so the actress should temper her delivery (take it down a notch) and recognize the collective focus of the production.The fans who never read the books will like it for the great story.

{"id": 943, "title": "Really bad nonsense and still pretentious and with weird editing", "content": "First some positives. I almost think the people behind these movies listened to the criticism towards the first movie. Although this is also beautiful to watch, and have great cinematography, it also, mostly, stays there. The first movie was an artsy pretentious documentary rather than a sci-fi movie. Wherein the first movie probably had 1 hour of wasted time such as useless establishing shoots and lingering camera on people doing nothing, but that in-between time here is mostly filled in with actual advancement of the story and development of the characters. We get a bit more of the story and overarching geopolitics so we actually can put things into context, which was lacking in the first movie.Sadly, although the things I mentioned above is much better, it is still some of the same issues and we also get a couple of new ones and some of them are huge. The scheming mother for example is over the top, and every time they fight or have a war scene I keep thinking: \"so... where are all the high tech weapons that can track and detect and blow people up across the planet?\" There are some Sci-fi weapons and shields and such of course, but these sand people would not stand a chance even against an army from earth, so how are they able to survive in these movies?All the new characters are horrible with Walken as the biggest disappointment. Most deaths are underwhelming to say the least. And in the end this movie turns into some weird mix of GOT season 8 and Avatar, and no, that is not a good thing.My final major complaint is that the editing feels wonky. It is almost like entire scenes are missing sometimes, and many jumps from one scene to the other is too abrupt. In the first movie we jumped from establish shoot to establishing shoot with looooong dragged out scenes, here it feels like they cut some of that out i.e. Perhaps they did not listen so much to the criticism but rather just cut out some unnecessary fluff.Summation: Although they fixed a lot of the issues from the first movie, this is still a lot worse. The acting is worse, the storytelling is worse, the fights are confusing and laughable. And the ending? What was that?This is really bad nonsense and complete waste of money.

They wanted to easily pull the new generations into their paid seats, so they turned it into the Zendaya and big worms show (Go, queen!).Chani, the real character, is pivotal for the complete story of Dune, but here they killed her in favor of Zendaya's bad acting as a 21 century teenager who has spent too much time on Youtube's echo-chambers watching videos about the patriarchy and how Israel and the Illuminati wants to control all minorities.In Herbert's book, and in the reality of a culture directly descendent from Islam like the Fremen, Chani would have died immediately after slapping the just proven Lisan al-Gaib. But, also, in those situations, Chani would have NEVER dared to raise her hand, or even have an opinion against the Lisan al-Gaib because the whole point of the Fremen is that they are unified by the cruel environment they live in. They have no time to ponder if their religion is true or false. In fact, there would be no way to have anybody doubt what the Bene Gesserit planted millennia ago. That's what made the Fremen ripe to be controlled by a Messiah figure, and that was what Herbert intended to demonstrate as a danger for humanity.And where the hell is Alia? One of the most unique and incredible characters ever made for fiction? How will she, if ever, become St. Alia of the Knife if she was robbed from her glory in the battle of Arrakeen?Where are the CHOAM and the Spacing Guild?As an isolated science fiction movie, it is impressive, as a Dune adaptation it's enraging.Imagine LOTR, but Sam is a kick-ass girl Hobbit warrior that in the end kills Sauron in battle because Frodo, wimp male-Hobbit that he is, lost the ring to Golum.I give a 10 as a production, and take away 5 for mauling the story in favor of an actress and society's imagined hypersensitivity.", "rating": 4, "sentiment": 0, "date": "3 March 2024", "name": "rommelluna-65416"}

It definitely dragged in places, especially the scenes in the desert.

While this is hinted at in the book, it is much more overt here. (It isn't until the second Book that Paul really starts to realize what a mess he's made of things.)The Character of Chani is a departure. While she is totally devoted to Paul in the book, here she's the one screaming that this is wrong (even though they are aiming for the same goal.)The character of Feyd Ruatha was really good as a villian, for anyone still traumatized by the image of Sting in metal speedos in the 84 version, this is so much better.

{"id": 955, "title": "A near-perfect movie.", "content": "Dune 2 is as good as an adaptation in film form can be. Casting, acting, world building, sound, cinematography, everything is great.Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet and Rebecca Ferguson are the stars of the show and both perfectly deliver the transition to manipulative, unsympathetic characters. Compared to the first one where they are victims of betrayal and you feel for their loss, in this one you only feel sympathy for them until you realize the only reason is knowing the Harkonnen are so much worse. Paul is not a hero, something the first movie didn't make clear.The rest of the cast is great. Javier Bardem, Josh Brolin and Stellan Skarsgard are great as usual. Dave Bautista has surprising range and seems to do his best work with Villeneuve on the helm. I'm seeing a lot of praise for Austin Butler and his performance was good, but not anything extraordinary. His character is a psychopath and doesn't leave much room for subtlety. Zendaya is good, but in the beginning it feels like she's replaying her character from Spider Man. She has only two modes, annoyed and concerned. She does much better on the second half. Christopher Walken is great, obviously, but it was distracting to cast such a well-known actor as a character that wasn't even shown before and who is very reserved and secluded by the very nature of his role.The movie is almost 3 hours long and it didn't feel that much, but it had some minor pacing issues. It feels rushed at some points and I think it lacked some transition scenes. For instance, I wanted to see more transitions with spaceships in space, like we see once in the first one. They make the vast distances between planets clearer and increase the sense of isolation and remoteness of Arrakis. The movie doesn't really feel like an interplanetary epic. It feels like everything is happening very close.I wish the role of spice was made clearer in the first one and it wasn't, so I was expecting that in this one and I was disappointed it was overlooked again. Without showing the navigators, their role and the transformations they go through, the spice feels more like a McGuffin than an integral part of the plot. I'm not a fan of the books but I know the navigators are really introduced only in Messiah. However, I think having an earlier hint of their role and the real importance of spice would make the stakes clearer, specially when we see Paul's visions about the future and his decision to go through with it, knowing what will happen.Overall, its few minor flaws are due to things that are missing, and I'm sure Villeneuve had to make many hard decisions about what to leave out of the movie to keep the runtime reasonable.", "rating": 10, "sentiment": 1, "date": "1 March 2024", "name": "rocinante-421-313928"}

The changes to the characters of Stilgar and Chani, both portrayed by great actors, left them with less depth. Stilgar is shown as more of a true believer than a lieutenant, and the complexity of the character in the book is that he is both. Likewise Chani loses depth by becoming more of a 'girlfriend' and less the visionary future mother of a god-emperor. Villeneuve overused made up languages, whose limited use I enjoyed in Part One, but found distracting here. The black-and-white color palette of Giedi Prime lost an opportunity to depict the industrial world in richer but unhealthy hues, perhaps stressing reds and purples as well as white and black, and avoiding greens, blues, and browns. Mere black and white made it seem less real than the brutal planet ruled by psychopaths depicted in the books. Great looking worms, desert landscapes, and special effects, moving music.

It is the pay-off fans of the first movie (me included) have been waiting three years for. Not only that, but the movie manages to offer a fascinating reflection on the role of messianic tales in both disrupting and perpetuating power...it is an action movie about something, which is rare. Not everything is perfect. The action towards the end starts to feel almost Star Wars like (not a compliment): hapless bad guys, shields that are conveniently not on, heroes who never feel threatened. Plus, it's hard to adapt a book series that went on forever and maintain any sense of closure movie to movie; in some ways, Part One had the advantage of everybody knowing things would end unresolved. I never expected anything but build up. Still, Villeneuve seems born to tell this kind of story, and the cast dives into this space opera like it is Shakespeare.

Rebecca Ferguson's screen-scorching sensuality is barely recognizable and wasted here, but the amiable Austin Butler transforms well from his turn as a sympathy-evoking Elvis into a cheerfully efficient serial killer. Once again, Javier Bardem steals scene after scene with his comically touching portrayal of destiny's true believer.Despite its flaws, this film still entertains, perhaps because we're so starved for the genre that we're more forgiving than the sand worms.But truly, if you're going all-in on a mega-production such as Dune Two, give a thought to the screenplay.

{"id": 983, "title": "We all wait for a Return of the King in Dune: Part Three", "content": "Dune: Part Two is a great work of science fiction, which will undoubtedly inspire many other filmmakers. However, it's not a perfect film, nor it's close to being one. I'm one of those meticulous viewers who are always attentive to every detail, and yes, Dune: Part Two has elements to repair and improve, especially in its editing, rhythm, and the chronology of the events presented in its plot. It's unfortunate. Without these small black points, in reality, it could have gotten closer to better grades and ratings, because it maintains the spectacularity, solemnity, and seriousness that made the first part a memorable work, knowing that it was a notorious prologue.If we delve into the most notable aspects of this film, several elements jump out to the eye and to the memory of everyone who has seen it: production design, direction, cinematography, sound, and costumes. All of these elements memorably appear on the screen, each one having enough starring time to appreciate it impeccably.The acting is also good, although some are weaker than others. As a good science fiction film with the immense budget it had, its visual effects are very good, giving a constant spectacle with the giant worms and the action sequences that involved several explosions.The third act of the film is one of the most powerful I have seen lately. Great plot outcome, great character development, great final climax. But for all this to have happened, the script has a great basal construction, shielding its protagonist with a religious, spiritual, and magical shield, in a strategically political, brutal, and ruthless world.This trilogy knows how to present itself as a serious work, taking its genre to the top of cinematographic preferences, just as the Lord of the Rings trilogy once did with medieval fantasy.

{"id": 985, "title": "A saga with gravitas and I want to see how it ends now. 75+%", "content": "These will be general impressions of this film, whereas my review of the first film was more detailed as far as characters and plot goes. In its initial release, many cinemas have been screening Dune and Dune: Part Two back-to-back, which I would recommend if you haven't seen the first film yet. The story is dense and you would be completely lost if you start watching this series with the sequel. That being said, there is handy plot exposition in the dialogue at the start to refresh your memory of what happened in the first film (I saw the first film in the cinema in early December, 2021 and didn't rewatch it prior to seeing Dune: Part Two today, although I have read my Dune review a few times since then, so that was also a refresher, of sorts).Not being fanatical about this story as far as reading the source material or watching the first Dune more than once, I have to say that I don't think that I grasped everything that happens in the sequel. I was vague on details about who people were or the origins of peoples. E.g. At the start of the film, I was thinking that a young woman was our hero's (Paul Atreides, played by Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet) sister but it turns out that she was his mother. My review of Dune doesn't mention that she looked too young to play his mother but she does. That Paul says \"sister\" around her sometimes didn't help me. Later on I saw an older man in a scene and I thought he might have been one of the good guys from the first film but since he was in a spice harvester now, I was confused. Why was he in that? I'm not sure that that is explained satisfactorily but that does raise one issue that I had with this film: being able to clearly understand the dialogue being spoken. Sometimes it was unclear due to characters' accents, other times due to ambient noise and other other times due to stylistic effects being utilised. It would have been good if I could have heard the last thing that Paul says to Baron Vladimir Harkonnen (played by Stellan Skarsg\u00e5rd). It's at times like these that being able to rewind the film or turn on closed captions would have been appreciated.Not being able to recall how romantically involved Paul was with Chani (Zendaya) in the first film, it did seem that in the sequel their romance blossomed at a very fast rate. Perhaps more time had elapsed that I realised within the sequel itself, as far as that went. Sometimes the transitions from one scene to a different one was unclear. For instance, there's one scene where Paul is meant to be having a trial in the desert by himself and in the next scene it wasn't clear to me that the man in a military ambush was him but in my defence, he did have his face covered in the latter scene. So, maybe these switches were handled too abruptly or maybe I just lost concentration during the transition.There are many times in Dune: Part Two where some of the 'natives' on the planet Arrakis comment that their religion is just a means for others to manipulate them for the other's political ends. Similarly, the same sentiment is expressed by some of the colonisers too. At the risk of sounding like comedian Kenny Everett's character Quentin Pose: \"religion is the opiate of the masses and yet...\". And yet, on the other hand, the all-female religious order does have what seems like supernatural abilities. In other words, it's hard to be definitive about what is happening with the hero's journey here.Another time I felt more detached watching this film was just finding silly how Paul exceeded the prophecies concerning 'the chosen one'. The signs or proof of Paul's prophetic status are magnified and overblown. Then there's the issue of him being white and being worshipped by the non-white 'natives'. No doubt there is a post-colonial critique to be made here. Just a question for myself: are the 'natives' of a Arrakis genuinely of this planet or were they just the first colonists there? Did the first film explain that? Did the book explain that? My last word on finding the film silly at times would be those scenes where characters worm-ski. Really? It's probably fortunate that no attempt is made in the film to try and rationalise that, because I doubt that I could suspend my disbelief.Towards the end of the film there was a point where I thought that that conclusion would serve as the end point of the series, perhaps. However, the story continued and made it obvious that that wouldn't be the case. Since I haven't read the book on which the films are based, if I was to hazard a guess, I would say that this Dune story would be a trilogy but I wouldn't rule out a 4th film in this arc. In other words, this would be a 3 or 4 film adaptation of the original Dune book by Frank Herbert (I imagine part 4 as being some sort of 3 hour epilogue). I'm still interested and invested in this story. I want to see how the relationship between Paul and Chani evolves. With this sequel, the worlds depicted did seem quite alien but the thought occurred to me that it would be familiar to people who lived in earlier times, for instance, those attending the Nuremberg rallies or the Colosseum 'back in the day'.Note: I didn't see a listing for a 3D screening for this film in cinemas here but the closing credits makes it clear that such a version exists. I can't vouch in that case as to how worthwhile it would be to view that version. When I saw one of the Disney Star Wars films in 3D it was laughably woeful on that front. The first Avatar film is the benchmark on that front.Random notes:* I toyed with scoring this film 70%, then 75% seemed most likely but I decided to add a \"+\" sign to that, which is my tipping point for adding a star to my rating, as IMDB does not do half stars.* I laughed out loud when one character said words to the effect that Paul's denial of being the messiah was proof Paul was the messiah!* Christopher Walken is such a distinctive looking individual that he stands out like a dog's bollocks, visually. The rest of the cast didn't have that 'baggage' with me, even though I've seen some of them in unrelated films. In other words, I thought \"that's Christopher Walken\" when I saw him. Perhaps you could say that his presence affected my 'immersion' in this world.* Nice misdirection in the final fight scene.* American pronunciation of \"Dune\" by Paul, as in \"doon\".* As per my review of the first Dune film, I've collected another IMDB \"Iron bladder\" trophy.", "rating": 8, "sentiment": 1, "date": "2 March 2024", "name": "dfle3"}

Before he drank the blue substance, Paul was deadset against the idea that he was a savior, deadset against igniting a fundamentalist revolution that would result in the death of Billions of people, whether human or non-human.

This is still a novel and some basic timelines, events and characters need to be respected, which are completely missing here. Although David Lynch's version is old and outdated, the director managed to fit almost all the important moments and events into three times less film time, while this one wastes time on Taliban chants, frog-like sound passwords, and meaningless lines between the \"Fremen\".

I grew sick of Chalamets face and all the reverence by his people (perhaps that was the point). All this buildup for a Messiah character, ok we get it, it's quite boring to see the prophecy coming true too.Plot advancement seemed to jump forward extremely quickly between scenes, one instance being when he's sent out into the desert on a survival trial, but the next minute he's back with the crew attacking the bad guys. Talking of the bad guys, the viewing experience was far more enjoyable to me whenever they had screen time, welcome relief from 'Mary Sue' Paul. The Harkonnens are a disgustingly evil bunch of folks and deserved more backstory.Then the anticipated epic final battle, what a dud. It's over in the blink of an eye and wraps up the film awkwardly.

Director Denis Villeneuve masterfully balances the grandeur of the landscape with the intimate struggles of its inhabitants, creating a cinematic experience that is as mesmerizing as it is thought-provoking.At the heart of \"Dune - Part 2\" lies a plot as intricate as the labyrinthine corridors of political power in India. Like a masterful chess game played on a cosmic scale, the narrative unfolds with a series of unexpected twists and turns, keeping audiences on the edge of their seats until the very end. Much like a Bollywood masala film, the story is rich with drama, intrigue, and larger-than-life characters whose destinies are intertwined in ways both profound and unforeseen.Yet, amidst the political machinations and intergalactic power struggles, \"Dune - Part 2\" introduces an unlikely hero: the sandworms of Arrakis. Previously viewed as mere beasts of burden, these colossal creatures emerge as symbols of resilience and defiance, challenging the established order and reshaping the very fabric of Indian cinema. Their presence adds a layer of myth and mystique to an already captivating narrative, serving as a reminder that true heroism often comes from the unlikeliest of places.What sets \"Dune - Part 2\" apart from other sci-fi epics is its ability to transcend the boundaries of genre and resonate with audiences on a deeply human level.

As audiences are transported to the far reaches of the universe, they are treated to a visual and auditory spectacle that elevates the already captivating narrative to new heights.From the moment the opening credits roll, \"Dune\" plunges viewers into a richly realized world of political intrigue and ancient prophecy. Villeneuve's masterful direction and Roger Deakins' breathtaking cinematography combine to create a visually stunning landscape that feels both familiar and alien. In IMAX, every sweeping vista of the desert planet Arrakis and every intricately detailed costume and set piece come to life with unparalleled clarity and depth, immersing audiences in a sensory experience unlike any other.At the heart of \"Dune\" lies a sprawling epic that follows the journey of Paul Atreides, played with depth and nuance by Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet. As the young scion of House Atreides, Paul finds himself thrust into a dangerous game of politics and power on Arrakis, where control of the planet's most valuable resource, spice, hangs in the balance. Chalamet's portrayal captures the complex inner turmoil of a young man torn between duty and destiny, as he grapples with his newfound role as the chosen one of prophecy.The supporting cast, including Rebecca Ferguson as Paul's mother Lady Jessica, Oscar Isaac as his father Duke Leto, and Zendaya as the mysterious Fremen warrior Chani, further enriches the tapestry of characters. Each actor brings depth and humanity to their roles, elevating the ensemble cast to new heights and ensuring that even the most minor characters leave a lasting impression on the audience.What sets \"Dune\" apart from other sci-fi epics is its meticulous attention to detail and richly textured world-building. Villeneuve and his team have crafted a universe that feels lived-in and authentic, from the intricate politics of the Great Houses to the customs and traditions of the desert-dwelling Fremen. In IMAX, every minute detail is brought to life with stunning clarity, allowing audiences to immerse themselves fully in the world of Arrakis and its inhabitants.But \"Dune\" is more than just a visually spectacular blockbuster; it is also a thought-provoking exploration of themes such as power, religion, and ecology. Herbert's novel, upon which the film is based, is renowned for its depth and complexity, and Villeneuve does justice to the source material by crafting a narrative that is both faithful to its roots and accessible to newcomers. In IMAX, the film's grand themes are brought into sharp relief, inviting audiences to ponder the nature of destiny and the consequences of our actions on the world around us.In conclusion, \"Dune\" is a cinematic triumph that delivers the perfect IMAX experience. Denis Villeneuve's visionary direction, coupled with stunning visuals and powerhouse performances, creates an epic saga that will leave audiences breathless.

Villeneuve acts as if he is eager to get to the end. It is a great show-off and you can sense the pride he has in his creation.Character development is lost here.

{"id": 1002, "title": "Visually stunning and thought-provoking epic", "content": "Denis Villeneuve returns to the vast deserts of Arrakis with Dune: Part Two, the highly anticipated follow-up to his 2021 adaptation of Frank Herbert's sci-fi masterpiece. This time, Paul Atreides (Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet) embraces his Fremen heritage and potential as the Kwisatz Haderach, all while navigating a complex web of political intrigue and impending war.While Part Two unquestionably builds on the stunning visuals and world-building established in the first film, it falters slightly in its emotional core. The grand scale often overshadows character development, leaving some relationships feeling underdeveloped. For instance, the simmering romance between Paul and Chani (Zendaya) feels rushed, despite Zendaya's captivating screen presence.However, the film excels when it digs into the complexities of power, fanaticism, and ecological responsibility. The Fremen's struggle against the ruthless Harkonnens resonates in our current climate crisis, prompting us to consider the true cost of resource exploitation. Stellan Skarsg\u00e5rd chews the scenery with glee as the grotesquely villainous Baron Harkonnen, while Rebecca Ferguson delivers another powerhouse performance as Paul's enigmatic mother, Lady Jessica.The technical aspects are, unsurprisingly, phenomenal. The Hans Zimmer score is a sonic marvel, perfectly complementing the film's epic visuals. The sandworm sequences are even more awe-inspiring than before, using CGI seamlessly to create creatures that feel both terrifying and majestic. The use of colour is particularly noteworthy, with the film's palette shifting from the harsh oranges and browns of Arrakis to the cooler blues and greens of Chani's visions, effectively highlighting the contrast between Paul's harsh reality and his potential future.The editing is brisk, making sure the film's nearly three-hour runtime never feels like a slog, although some might find the pacing slightly uneven, particularly in the expository middle section. The dialogue, while not overly quotable, is functional and propels the plot forward.Dune: Part Two is a visually stunning and thought-provoking sci-fi epic that expands upon the universe established in the first film. While it might not quite deliver on emotional depth, it's a more-than-worthy sequel that will leave you thirsty for more of this unique story. So go see it!

{"id": 1003, "title": "An exceeding scope of a Sci-fi sequel by Denis Villeneuve", "content": "Dune Part Two\nIt has come to full fruition. Denis Villeneuve's Dune series might be the greatest sci-fi series in cinematic history. The new age of cinema has shown its potential to not just adapt in filmmaking but to show a great storyline and potentially become a classic in centuries to come. And I believe that with all of my heart. Denis Villeneuve's Dune series will be the sci-fi film that will share the throne as the greatest amongst the classics.It's a wild thing to say for a latest-release film, and I do understand the recency bias phenomenon among moviegoers. But I also believe Denis Dune will grow on people from time to time, as I felt that myself with Dune Part One rewatches and also my observation on the audiences latest reviews on Dune Part One rewatch.There are two eyewitnesses to this film: the novel non-readers and the readers. It is a bipartite review as to how they perceived this film, and I can say that I'm jealous of how non-readers might perceive this film. While I might see the words becoming a full visualization, I'm also trying to perceive how non-readers see its story.From this statement, it's due to how there are quite plenty of omissions and changes in the storyline from the novel, and the way I'm wording it doesn't indicate a bad thing, but it's a \"huh\" moment for me as I immersed myself in the story with a new perception. I believe most non-readers will see it as a linear, perfect storyline, but it's different for me, and this is not entirely a bad thing.To sum up the statement, Denis and Jon have done a tremendous job on the storyline and screenwriting, and I have to say it's the best decision yet to make the storyline go in the other direction. Most of the new scenes leave me in a great shock at how well told it is and how unexpectedly it turned out to be played, especially the ending.The words for this storyline are more fierce and cruel.Dune Part Two is an experience, not just a film of fiction. It is dramatic in its depth, poignant in its love story, profound and cruel in its motive, and epic in its style that's grandeur and maximized to near perfection.I'm blown away by how Denis managed to achieve this level of mastery in an adaptation of the greatest sci-fi novel in history. Dune Part Two is a masterpiece and beautifully adapted.It just gets better.Moving away from the main thematic entrance to this cinematic desert masterpiece. I just have to talk about the ingredients that make this film as spicy as it gets.The cinematography is top-notch and one of the most remarkable aspects of this film. The film was a whole 2 hours and 40 minutes of eye-catching experience to be immersed on a big screen. This film managed to capture lots of moments in this scene that'll make you go, \"Hell yeah, that's fire.\"The color grading for this film has its way to be most deliberate and non-subtle but will make you feel the atmospheric changes in the film, capturing the moment so well with how it is done. You'll know what I mean here...All this couldn't be done without the creative mind of Greg Frasier and perfect visualizations by Denis Villeneuve. Reading the texts and seeing how it's done in the film is one of the blessings I felt in my cinematic experience.Hans Zimmer is truly a work of art. His craft manages to consistently elevate one after the other in his film scores. The Dune Part Two soundtrack is perfectly conveyed with the instruments played and will put you in every emotion to be felt in this film.I believe Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet has outdone himself in this film. There are many doubts lingering about this young actor, but this film will definitely solidify them. The acting was fierce and potent enough to grip you to the edge of your seat, and I'm going to tell you to prepare for what's to come.It has always been a topic of him being overrated, but hopefully Dune Part Two will prove doubters wrong and how talented Timoth\u00e9e actually is. One of the greatest young actors in this new era of cinema, with a wide range of acting.Austin Butler as Feyd-Rautha is exceptional casting that is once again unexpected. Like Timoth\u00e9e said in an interview, he has to prove himself for this film, and now it's Austin's turn, and he's actually done it. It is not an exaggeration when the word psychotic is thrown around. He truly is...Dare I say it? Feyd-Rautha is way more psychotic and villainous than he is in the novel, and you just have to witness it.I have every word to say about each actor and actress, but I couldn't prolong it. Timoth\u00e9e and Austin are prime examples of how well-acted this film is, and you guys have to witness others acting masterfully on the big screen.My honorable mention before ending this review is how perfectly they created the Chakobsa language.David Peterson and Denis managed to give this language depth with how dramatic the language sounds when it's spoken. It doesn't feel made up for the sake of being an incomprehensible language, but rather realistic and felt.Dune Part Two is definitely worth a watch as it's healing sci-fi and action cinema right now, and I think everyone deserves to experience this in their lifetime.

This might make some audience members less invested, but I really respect that creative choice.Can not wait for Part 3!", "rating": 10, "sentiment": 1, "date": "3 March 2024", "name": "dstaster"}

The scenery/sets, the music, the cast, the plot, the fight scenes... all really good stuff. Objectively, this is a GOOD movie.Here are other stuff I liked before people get upset: I really liked Fade and Chani. Both of them were well written and acted. Fade was fantastic, and I loved the changes to Chani's character from the book. I laughed when she left Paul at the end. As she should!! I liked how she had her own views and didn't just blindly follow Paul. Speaking of Paul, wow, the scene where he spoke to all the Fremen was great. Actually, ALL the actors did a great job at portraying their characters.I also want to say that I read the book and loved it. I also watched the original 1984 movie and loved it. So, what went wrong?? Well...Now, here's what I DIDN'T like about this movie. Let's just say that I'm mad for personal reasons. My sister was named after Paul's sister. This new movie not only didn't say her name at all (Alia), but they cut her out of the movie by making her not be born yet. I don't want to sound petty, but she had such an important part in the original that cutting her out completely changed the story!!With all the talk of having Jessica and Chani do more in this adaptation (which I like!!), cutting out Alia killing the Baron and making Paul do it was very backwards thinking. Paul already kills Fade, why make him kill the Baron too?? And he just walked in and stabbed him with everyone watching??? HUH?? Very anti-climatic... at least make Jessica do it if you had to change it! Alia killing the Baron is so iconic!!So yeah, I'm upset that Alia was cut out. At least she WAS still in it... there were other stuff I didn't like too. I thought the first half was very slow paced. And I LIKE slow movies!! But this one felt like they were in the desert for way too long... that's what happens when you stretch a movie into two parts. Also, the end battle was like 15 minutes tops?? With all the build-up, it could have been longer. And then it just... ended?? Without SHOWING it end?? They just said \"the battle's over\". What???Anyway, that's my take. I'm being honest. There were stuff I liked and stuff I didn't, but I'm just personally mad that they cut out my sister's namesake. I'm glad other people liked it though, and I'm glad it was made and adapted for a modern audience, but I recommend reading the book. It still holds up!", "rating": 5, "sentiment": 1, "date": "6 March 2024", "name": "ardenyoung-25866"}

There's 1 theme going whenever something important happens and it fits great, but, due to repetition of it, at some point you begin to just phase it out. Diune 1 - remember the scene of Atreides being attacked by Harkonnen and Sardaukars? That scene, that music. It burned into my memory. There's no such thing in Dune 2, unfortunately.

{"id": 1019, "title": "Beware of the South, that's where the fundamentalists are", "content": "Here comes the first big movie of 2024, Denis Villeneuve's Dune Part II. After years of tropey rot and arty trash coming out of Hollywood it's nice to see these popular/spectacular epics in the classic tradition: the past few years have yielded Oppenheimer, Killers of the Flower Moon, Maverick, and now the complete Dune adaption. (Well, complete adaption of the first book at least). There are moments here that remind you how awesome movies can be.This may be Villeneuve's most visually inventive film yet, as well as his most propulsive. He's still an art-house director at heart, and doesn't quite have the commitment to or comfort in grand spectacle the way Peter Jackson did, but is able to paint an engrossing world nonetheless. The nearly three hours fly past while watching it. The mid-plot detour to the Harkennon planet is a high point, with its inkblot fireworks and black sun that paints the outside world in monochrome. (This almost functions as a meta gag aimed at the critics who found Dune 1 too colorless). The production design is massive and (maybe excessively) Brutalist. There is a lot of open space and very little ornamentation.How does it fare character-wise? Not quite as well, though for the most part it's faithfully following Herbert's writing. Butler and Bardem are standouts as the psychotic Feyd-Rautha and the comically superstitious Stilgar respectively. The major changes from the book mostly concern Zendaya's Chani (in the book she's basically just Paul's concubine); remade here into the voice of modern audiences, she ridicules the prophecies and criticizes Paul's Messianic rise.This change is somewhat justified since Paul's conflict in the book is almost completely internal, and the film needs someone to voice it out loud, and Chani is the logical choice. The problem (or maybe strength, depending on how one looks at it) is that it doubles down on the film's thematic ambiguity in ways that Villeneuve probably did not intend.Villeneuve has made it very clear that the film is meant to be a dissection of messiah narratives, showing how belief in a messiah can lead to fanaticism and destruction. However, the world he (and originally Herbert) have constructed is so dysfunctional that death and destruction seem par for the course anyway. Just about every faction in the Dune universe is vying and backstabbing others for its own gain, and by giving Chani the politically-correct concern *only* for her own people, she seems about the same. Only Stilgar defies this trend, and as a result comes off as the most likable figure. He's still something of a buffoon, and his habit of attributing every event to some obscure prophecy drew a lot of laughs in the theater. But he's the only character who believes in something higher than himself. It gives him a kind of nobility, which, even if misplaced, contrasts with the Game of Thrones-esque machinations of everyone else. And the film never explicitly shows that his prophecies are *not* true, (even if they were planted by the Bene Gesserit), creating the main conflict. Is Paul destined to become a messiah, or is he only allowing himself to become one because the prophecies say he will? The question is not answered (maybe saved for the rumored third installment; I have not read Herbert's Dune sequels). Again, this is Villeneuve the art-house director playing with ambiguity. When Paul abruptly leans full tilt into his space-dictator role, it was so grandiose that cynicism fell away, leaving me fully onboard with his jihad, and this is Timothee Chalamet that we're talking about. After all this Chani comes off as a bit of a loser. It seems absurd that in this kind of world she wouldn't want to be connected with the most powerful figure in the universe. Only the Machiavellian types seem to ever succeed.There is a lot of talk about how this film is the defining epic of a generation, how it's better than Star Wars, it's this generation's Lord of the Rings, etc. This is hyperbole. I wouldn't expect the series to have that kind of impact, primarily because (A) it's quite emotionally distant since the characters are non-heroic, and (B) as implied above, it's more intellectual than crowd-pleasing; the Dune world is objectively kind of depressing despite its aesthetic coolness.

The actors filled in the personalities of each character. Their overall tone of dialogue matched the motivations they had. Like how Lady Jessica is being more manipulative than ever. Rebecca Ferguson was a phenomenal actress. Zendaya also shined. Her character's desperation for saving Paul was heartbreaking, and she nailed the right emotions for Chani. And Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet is a very versatile actor. I love every movie he is into. The scene where he spoke to the Fremen underground as the Lisan al Gaib gave me chills, even though the movie felt hot.Second are the visual effects. As a cinephile who always looks for the visuals of a film, this movie outshined itself. It captured the whole environment depicted in the novel series. It was a breathtaking experience because it is quite rare to watch movies that were taken in a deserted place taking place in a different world. The appearance of the sandworm, or shai-hulud, made an impact. Its colossal magnitude shook the whole theater like I was there riding it. The scenes in Giedi Prime were cool, including the battle scene with Feyd. With its brutalist architecture and the monochrome color grading, it's so atmospheric.With the ability of Hans Zimmer to describe emotions through music, the score resonates with the mystique of the Dune universe. It triggers awe for something so unworldly, but mixed with a warning of imminent danger, it totally fits the movie's narrative.The writing also still landed. The great pacing connected it to the previous film and made a path for the movie's direction. I sat for 2 hours straight and never felt any boredom at all; it made me more excited. The build-up to the climax was crazy. Fleshing out new characters and adding them for more political turmoil and hindrances up to the final battle between Paul and Feyd, it was intense and menacing.The mixture of real-world cultures of Middle Eastern countries blends well with the theme of the movie, which was all about foreign colonizers using fear and faith as their tool to control. The theme made me question my reality. \"How are we going to believe?\" Are we just going to wait until a prophecy is fulfilled, or are we going to make it a reality? The movie warned me about the danger that a false belief could pose.Thank you, Denis Villeneuve, for carrying the new generation of sci-fi genre films and the whole of Hollywood itself.

Probably will be my favourite movie of the year.\n                \n                    3 out of 4 found this helpful.\n                        \n                            Was this review helpful?

The second part is just as spectacular as the first, continuing as before with a combination of eerie other worldly atmosphere, incredible tech spectacle, plenty of noisy action, but with a coherent plot, and in this part there's also quite a lot of delving into the more meaningful aspects of Herbert's concepts and ideas.Overall, it's a thrilling and immersive movie, technically breathtaking and often dramatically powerful, and even when it's also rather odd it tries hard to stay close to its origins and I think mostly succeeds.

So some real subtleties which were hidden in the imax viewing, and totally covered with music in the first moviethe music has been massively dialled back, thankfully, from the first movie .. there are less of those vocal sections which I found really irritating in the first one, and other subtle synth layers can be more easily heard. I hope they revisit the soundtrack in the first movie later and dial it back in a similar way eg. Scenes like House Atreides leaving their home planet, and performances like the death of Liet Kynes would be way more powerful if left primarily to sound, with more dialled back and lower music. The music really ate up those scenes and performancesthe visuals of course are amazing, especially the sand worms are incredible, and the imploding Harkonnen fireworks are a great creative touchsome slight negatives.. I found the importance of the spice goes missing, and this would only require a couple of additional scenes or sentences to rectify. Without it space travel ceases, but the audience is not reminded of this very huge detail. Blink and you will miss it in the first movie. Also the Fremen have some very sophisticated weapons and tech that goes unexplained, like huge triangular blasts and so onsome of the casting choices are slightly questionable .. I really love Christopher Walken but I was not buying him as the Emperor. He has become so well known as a funny talking new york tough guy, I quite expected him to pull out a revolver or something like that at some point, or come out with some witty lengthy dialogue before shooting the Baron in the knee caps. I fear the inevitable extra cast members that we will get in the third movie for the other houses as more and more A list actors inevitably will want to have their names on the franchiseLike with Star Wars ESB I'm expecting this to be the best of the three movies and I am hoping when Dune is completed, that Denis Villeneuve will have the opportunity to direct a third Blade Runner movie ..", "rating": 9, "sentiment": 1, "date": "10 March 2024", "name": "vailsy"}
{"id": 1027, "title": "Avatar for Grown Ups ;)", "content": "Just finished watching 1 hour ago this powerful display of story, visuals, and sound wrapped together in a saga forever traveling. Things you ask for in this film arrive and curiosity for more follows closely. This is my first review of any film I've looked at and I am happy to make Dune: Part Two my statement piece. This movie is the silent killer because I believe there will be quite a few that sleep on this film looking for a different action-type of blockbuster but believe you me after I watched the first Dune, I was hooked for the sequel. And while I can't say I was surprised, for some of the story angles I was. Take this from someone who knows nothing of the Dune novels or previous movies. Something never quite lured me before in the past when I watched parts of Dune, but delivery of this revisited epic introduces perfect calms before the storm as well as the endurance of their experience. You feel as if placed under a dreamlike trance, and when necessary, brought into focus for intentional importance.Major highlights for me watching Dune beyond abovementioned are the interwoven threads between all characters, the affinity of reverence of the desert life (or lack thereof in some cases \ud83d\ude0a), demanding common sense naturalness, conservation of idle chatter, and grip of coolness among the heat. I wanted freedom of room in the theater so I watched the presentation on standard screen but will most likely return for a 2nd showing to see on IMAX to get a deeper effect. All I can say is that whomever you are reading this, watching this film, you will not be disappointed on the journey and maybe you too will show up here on IMDB to give your first review on a movie that decisively gives faith back into Hollywood production. Bravo! And let's watch the next one \ud83d\ude09", "rating": 9, "sentiment": 1, "date": "9 March 2024", "name": "CriticVisual"}
{"id": 1028, "title": "It surely isn't an adaptation of Frank Herbert's Dune", "content": "Frank Herbert's (and to a lesser extent his son Brian Herbert) books are literary masterpieces. I have read all of them many times over the years and have never felt bored.The Sci-Fi channel's adaptation of the books (made in the year 2000) is marvellous. It remains fairly true to the books and hence extremely watchable, repeatedly even. The successor series, Children of Dune, is not half-bad either. All with a star cast of not so well known actors, barring very few exceptions who are quite famous. And that series gets a rating of 6.9 while this trash movie gets 9, wow!The first movie was quite good, the plot remained quite faithful to the books and overall, I looked forward to the second and maybe more instalments with some degree of anticipation.But somewhere along the way, the decision to turn the multi-faceted epic to a space opera seems to have been made.A few glaring divergences lead us to this travesty of a movie.No mention of Dr. Liet Kynes in this movie, so some mystical mumbo-jumbo of greening.No mention of Kanly, so the seriousness of the Paul-Feyd fight is dumbed down to a grudge match. Also, no Atreides gom Jabbar for the Baron Harkonnen.The Bene Gesserit are reduced to one dimensional characters. Their only \"superpower\" is Voice. No mention of their \"weirding ways\". Their superior training leading to control over their body chemistry which is a critical component of the Water of Life transformation is glossed over to such an extent to be almost absent.The whole Imperial setup is laughable. If the few images of Corrin are supposed to be representative, no wonder Shaddam is so pitiable a character. And let's not look at the caricatures that are the Sardaukar.Lastly, what's with the exclusion of the Spacing Guild in this movie? After all, they were there in the first movie, albeit as minor characters. In the books, they were described as the third of a triad of political forces, the other two being the Emperor and the Great Houses. Without them, the climax sequence in this movie is greatly reduced. If you don't believe me, please take a look at the same scene in the Sci-Fi adaptation. Now that one is class all the way!Overall, the only charitable conclusion I can make here is that this is a movie that borrows the title, the names of the characters and seemingly little else from the titular books. It definitely doesn't borrow the plot to any great degree, so this ends up being a boring pace opera.", "rating": 1, "sentiment": 0, "date": "5 March 2024", "name": "srishailc"}

{"id": 1030, "title": "The most overrated movie in a decade", "content": "How many times haven't we seen movies that people try to build up like masterpieces even before they get released, that is also the case with Dune Part Two who already was expected to be the next Lord Of The Rings franchise or something like that. If they managed to actually deliver on that it would be no problem, but this movie is actually even worse than the first one and dragged in a lot of moments.I would really say it is heavily overrated because when you create a movie that lasts almost 3 hours you need to create more quality, Denis Villeneuve the director here recently talked about that people want longer movies, but then he needs to create more quality in the process.It especially feels dragged after Atredes drinks that water of life to see visions even stronger, and it becomes once again all about building up an even greater war you of course remember in the first movie that you tried to build up this great war, but now you build up an even greater war which will happen in 3'rd movie but in that process it becomes a dragged affair. You have some fight scenes some talk about alliances but things are done very messy here and it includes the fight scenes, which only show about one good fight. The one between Atredes and. Feyd Rautha where you manage to create intensity. The rest are pretty weak and there's a general feeling that you are supposed to feel the tense dramatic mood with the music rather than you should see the movie deliver intensity and dramatic moments in the scenes.Another problem is the general forced creation of comic moments in the movie. That is especially seen in the Stilgar character that goes on a forced rampage trying to make everybody laugh when in reality it is just a forced attempt to create jokes, which are not really funny but of course everybody in the cinema laughs at them.. because they feel forced too or are so spellbound by the Dune movie. That's why also the movie at times actually can feel childish. That's not to say that you can't have comic moments, but they do not need to be so forced.Another issue I will discuss are the too many characters which I feel we see in a lot of movies these days, with the character gallery here it is hard to create a good movie. In addition the evil guys like Rabban, The emperor played by Christopher Walken and Feyd Rautha are hardly in this movie when they actually are very much interesting character but really aren't allowed to shine that much. Because the story has a heavy buildup where Atredes needs to be the master of the desert and gain the confidence from The Fermen to be their leader and those moments are the most important in this one, the creation of a legend of his own that almost could have been the first movie and the second could have been the prequel.That's another problem I think that this movie although it builds on the first movie, but it really feels like a part of a double buildup. Which then again throws me away from calling it a masterpiece, of course I am not saying we need war all the time but the focus is so much on the desert people and less on the evil side trying to take down Atredes and we don't see tense fights, so that's why for me I am dissapointed and I can't stretch my rating to more than a 5/10.", "rating": 5, "sentiment": 1, "date": "29 February 2024", "name": "kenny_funney"}

{"id": 1039, "title": "Best Movie", "content": "Dune,\" directed by Denis Villeneuve, stands as a monumental achievement in modern filmmaking, epitomizing the perfect fusion of visionary storytelling, breathtaking visuals, and captivating performances. As the second installment in Villeneuve's adaptation of Frank Herbert's epic science fiction saga, \"Dune 2\" surpasses its predecessor in every aspect, solidifying its status as a cinematic masterpiece deserving of a perfect 10/10 rating.One of the most striking elements of \"Dune 2\" is its visual prowess. From the barren landscapes of Arrakis to the intricately designed technology of the futuristic universe, every frame is meticulously crafted to immerse the audience in the rich tapestry of Herbert's universe. Cinematographer Greig Fraser masterfully captures the grandeur of the desert planet, using sweeping shots and dynamic camera movements to evoke a sense of scale and awe. The visual effects, seamlessly integrated into the narrative, enhance the film's otherworldly atmosphere, transporting viewers to a universe where the impossible becomes tangible.However, \"Dune 2\" is not merely a feast for the eyes; it is also a triumph of storytelling. Villeneuve and screenwriter Jon Spaihts skillfully navigate the complex narrative of Herbert's novel, distilling its intricate plot and multifaceted characters into a coherent and engrossing cinematic experience. The film's pacing is expertly calibrated, allowing the story to unfold organically while maintaining a sense of urgency and tension. Each scene is imbued with meaning, contributing to the overarching themes of power, destiny, and the human condition.Central to the film's success are the performances of its ensemble cast. Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet delivers a tour de force performance as Paul Atreides, the reluctant hero burdened with the weight of prophecy. Chalamet brings depth and vulnerability to the role, embodying Paul's internal struggle with grace and nuance. Opposite him, Rebecca Ferguson shines as Lady Jessica, Paul's mother torn between duty and love. Ferguson infuses her character with strength and complexity, elevating her beyond the typical female archetype often found in science fiction.The supporting cast is equally impressive, with each actor bringing their A-game to the table. Oscar Isaac commands the screen as Duke Leto Atreides, projecting authority and compassion in equal measure. Zendaya captivates as Chani, the mysterious Fremen warrior caught in the midst of a brewing conflict. Josh Brolin, and Javier Bardem round out the ensemble, delivering memorable performances that add depth and dimension to the film's ensemble.Beyond its technical and narrative achievements, \"Dune 2\" is a triumph of thematic depth and philosophical inquiry. At its core, the film grapples with timeless questions about power, identity, and the nature of humanity. Through Paul's journey, we are forced to confront the consequences of our actions and the moral complexities of leadership. Villeneuve deftly explores these themes, challenging the audience to reflect on their own beliefs and values.In addition to its thematic richness, \"Dune 2\" is a masterclass in world-building. Villeneuve and his creative team have painstakingly brought Herbert's universe to life, from the intricacies of its political landscape to the nuances of its cultural traditions. Every detail, from the costumes to the set design, is thoughtfully crafted to immerse the audience in the world of Arrakis and its inhabitants. The result is a fully realized and immersive cinematic experience that transports viewers to a distant future unlike anything they've ever seen before.In conclusion, \"Dune 2\" is nothing short of a cinematic triumph. With its breathtaking visuals, compelling storytelling, and powerhouse performances, it surpasses its predecessor and cements itself as a modern classic. Denis Villeneuve has created a masterpiece that not only honors Frank Herbert's seminal work but also pushes the boundaries of what science fiction cinema can achieve. \"Dune 2\" is not just a film; it's an experience-one that deserves to be celebrated and remembered for years to come.", "rating": 10, "sentiment": 1, "date": "9 March 2024", "name": "raquel-02082"}

Stunning cinematography, a well-crafted story, rare errors that are almost unnoticeable, and unparalleled acting performances from the entire cast.

Many events follow and the sequences are more than wonderful. The movie tries to introduce you into the world of the Freeman. After the first hour, I almost know their customs and responses. They did things as if I belonged to them, and on top of all of this the scenes are great and the angles make you feel ecstatic. The opening scene is terrible and the ending scene is beyond excellent. An epic movie. The action is new and the method of fighting is unfamiliar. There are some light comedic scenes, but they really made me laugh, and the IMAX experience is truly awesome.

The movie is an adaptation of Frank Herbert's classic science-fiction novel, and it is the second installment of the \"Dune\" franchise. Directed by Denis Villeneuve, the film is a visual spectacle that showcases the director's mastery of the art of filmmaking.The movie follows the story of Paul Atreides, a young boy who is destined to become the leader of the desert planet Arrakis. The planet is known for its valuable resource, the spice, which is essential for space travel. The story is set in a futuristic world where humanity has colonized other planets and is ruled by powerful families. The Atreides family is tasked with taking control of Arrakis from the Harkonnens, who have been in charge of the planet for many years.The film's visual effects are stunning, and the artists behind them have shown creativity and dedication that is second to none. The world of Arrakis is brought to life with incredible attention to detail, and the landscapes are awe-inspiring. The sand dunes, the gigantic sandworms, and the futuristic technology are all seamlessly integrated into the story, making the audience feel like they are part of the Fremen and living with them seeing what happened with the same eye.The acting is also outstanding. Timothee Chalamet delivers a powerful performance as Paul Atreides, bringing depth and complexity to the character. Rebecca Ferguson and Zendaya are also excellent in their roles, bringing a sense of depth into their characters. The cast is rounded out by talented actors such as Austin Butler, Florence Pugh, and Christopher Walken, who all deliver outstanding performances.The story of \"Dune: Part Two\" is compelling and engaging, and it is excellently laid out. The film has a good pacing which is better than the first one and never feels tedious at any moment. The pacing is just great, and the story unfolds in a way that keeps the audience engaged from beginning to end. The movie is a testament to the power of storytelling, and it is a reminder that great storytelling is timeless.One of the most impressive aspects of \"Dune: Part Two\" is the way it balances action and drama. The film is not just a sci-fi adventure; it is also a character-driven drama that explores themes such as family, power, and destiny. The action scenes are thrilling and well-executed, but they never feel gratuitous or over-the-top. They are always in service of the story, and they help to advance the plot and develop the characters.Overall, \"Dune: Part Two\" is a movie that will leave you in awe. It is a cinematic masterpiece that showcases the best of what modern filmmaking has to offer. If you are a fan of science fiction or the \"Dune\" franchise, then this movie is a must-see. It is a movie that will stay with you long after the credits roll. I was just so happy to experience it.", "rating": 10, "sentiment": 1, "date": "10 March 2024", "name": "seapaphonx"}

{"id": 1049, "title": "Dune 2 Marks a Grand Achievement in Diminishing Returns", "content": "Denis Villeneuve's Dune project may still end up being one of the defining cinematic productions of this decade. The first film was a thunderclap of ambition; a shot in the arm for the lost art of the Epic. It set the stage for something like the 2020's version of Peter Jackson's Lord of the Rings. In other words, the next great epic saga in movies. Dune Part II, for all its enormous hype, doesn't quite fulfill the promise of that first introduction to Arrakis by way of Villeneuve. This is a smaller, less monumental film that the first. It lacks the freshness, the wonder of discovery that defined the appeal of that 2021 film. But as the last shots of this newest Dune hint, this is not the end of the line. Could it be that an epic conclusion comes along and puts this middle piece into proper context? Time will tell.One of the unavoidable problems with Dune Part II is its opening sections. Dune 2 begins with moments that, in the book, require the buildup of everything that has happened before. A sequence of Rebecca Ferguson's Jessica drinking the Water of Life is meant to be a crescendo of her character's arc. Instead, it comes with little fanfare at the very beginning of this movie. Same goes for Paul's worm-taming set-piece, which works properly only when teased over the course of time. Here, it appears right on schedule at the movie's midpoint. Dutiful storytelling, but without full impact. To make matters even less impactful, Dune 2 also ends with a pseudo-cliffhanger. Although all the material of the first book has been covered by the time we reach the credits, there is little sense of finality to this film's finale. The truth is that there is a narrative flow issue in Dune 2's pipes. A sluggish beginning and pomp-deficient ending being the main culprits.But you have to take a movie like this in its full glory. When you do that, you see a continuation of the same level of craft, ingenuity, and ambition as Dune Part I. Denis Villeneuve is an undisputed superstar among blockbuster directors, and his strengths are readily present in Dune 2. The stark, bold visual palette, and obsessive attention to world-building are all there once again, albeit in smaller doses. We do get, for example, an astounding hiatus on Giedi Prime-an entire chunk of movie entirely designed to amaze the senses-but much of Dune 2 is subdued. Sights that we expect to take our breath away, such as the many Fremen rituals that pepper the film, are instead muted, practical affairs. It may be that Villeneuve is making a stylistic choice with his \"down-and-dirty\" Fremen designs, and it may even be a smart one. But it's a choice that diminishes the strange alien wonder that vaulted the first Dune into something truly special. This time the visual and aural amazement only shows up for scant moments instead of enveloping the whole picture.It seems like the filmmaking qualities of Dune 2 are a given, but it is important to remember that stuff like sincere storytelling and controlled, considered visual ambition are traits rarely found in the world of mega-blockbusters. If Dune 2 is not the overwhelming experience its predecessor was, it is still a major movie event, and one I recommend engaging with. With time, and a stronger sequel, we may yet crown Denis Villeneuve's Dune as one of the Great achievements in movie history.74/100.", "rating": 8, "sentiment": 1, "date": "12 March 2024", "name": "jaredpahl"}
{"id": 1050, "title": "Dune, but dumbed down for modern audiences", "content": "From my early childhood days, I've been a fan of Dune. I read the book, played the video games (Cryo, Westwood) and came to love the David Lynch movie as I grew older.Denis Villeneuve is a very talented filmmaker, and after seeing Prisoners and Blade Runner 2049, I was eager to see his take on Dune. He's clearly very passionate about the material, but not in the aspects that inspired previous artists.Where David Lynch and the games allowed for opulent, fantastical designs, Villeneuves Dune is entirely minimalist in design and mostly devoid of color, shot almost entirely in beige. The costume design feels uninspired and cobbled together, and most of the edgy, LSD trip fever dream aspects of Dune have been removed alltogether. The guild and navigators are never seen, the Baron's homosexuality and grossness are gone, the violence is neutered, and the complicated space politics and backstory are removed entirely. How can you have Dune without space politics??The new Dune films run a combined 5 hours, but cover less narrative than the David Lynch film does in 3 hours (I'm referring to the extended fanedit, the only version to watch).Lynch embraced the weirdness and otherworldliness of Dune. His film feels like an opulent lsd trip, with a dream like quality. It also doesn't shy away of starting with a nearly 10 minute exposition dump. This backstory is needed to truly appreciate the story of Dune. The character relations are far more complex, with the power dynamics and scheming between Shaddam, the Spacing Guild, the Bene Gesserit and Harkonnen given ample time to be explored. In the new movie you never once learn that the emperor is himself at the mercy of the guild.Likewise, the Harkonnen feel neutered and incompetent.As I wrote in the headline, it's still Dune, but dumbed down.Instead, much more emphasis is given to the Fremen, arguably one of the least interesting factions of Dune. They are arguably more accurately portrayed in Villeneuves movie. Where they felt incompetent in Lynchs version, here they feel dangerous and fanatical, as they should. I also like that they did away with the weirding modules and instead focused on the personal shields.Now all this may sound like I dislike the new movies. I don't. There's much to love. While I prefer Lynchs more theatrical take, the new movie's more intimate style of direction makes for a very interesting and engaging experience in its own right.The acting is great almost across the board. The one exception may be Zendaya's Chani, though that may just be because of how the role is written. They made her too \"modern\" compared to the book, and ending the film on her frown doesn't really work.On the other hand, Hans Zimmer's score esoecuakky during that scene stands out as one of the best of his career, and should earn him an academy award.The effects look great for the most part, though here and there things are hidden in the old digital dust plooms.The editing stood out to me with some very clever scene transitions.It's a great film, no doubt. But it's not a great Dune adaptation, because it omits too much of what makes Dune more than your average space opera.Villeneuve's Dune is a fine addition to the canon alongside Lynch's original and the TV Mini-series. All of them are worth watching, and I can see good reasons why each version might be someone's favorite.

Leaving aside the time worn trope of the white savior coming to redeem the backwards, darker skin people, and the evil villain who lacked any depth or redeeming qualities at all, the story generally was reasonable except for the end when the aged emperor, for some unimaginable reason, decides to personally accept a challenge from an upstart leader on a distant (though strategically important) planet by personally going to that planet to crush him. Why would the elderly emperor of galactic empire take such a risk when he could send his army to do it? Also, if anyone could become emperor simply by challenging the existing emperor, there would be constant challenges from the great houses trying to gain the throne. I found that glaringly irrational decision and nonsensical part of the plot difficult to overlook. And despite all the talk of Paul Atreides being some sort of messiah, he didn't actually do anything messianic except survive drinking poison. One final point: as much as I like Christopher Walken, he was terribly mis-cast as the emperor. I just couldn't buy it.The movie was visually quite stunning in parts and the exploration of Paul and his mother's acceptance into the population of the desert people was well done. The battle scenes were really good and didn't look like CGI and the scenes of the people riding the giant worms were great cinematography. The music was way, way over the top. It was very loud and very dramatic, even in scenes that would have been better with more a more subtle musical background.

{"id": 1058, "title": "The one that was long overDune for modern Hollywood ;)", "content": "When I watched the first part of Dune I did not want to judge it completely. I did write a review on it mainly from the perspective of a visual experience and not much on the storytelling. Villeneuve's got quite the reputation on his storytelling with his previous directorial ventures. He did quite a good setup with Dune Part One with the world building and characterization. The climax of Dune: Part One felt like it's just the beginning and Dune: Part Two pretty much almost continues the story right from the same moment. The two parts have definitely been one of the most well structured sequels that I have seen in recent times but somehow the overall experience did not blow me away.The plot progression is pretty much how one expects it to be, especially for the ones who have read the book and watched the old movie. Dennis Villeneuve adds a twist of his own and also has played around with the characterization a little bit which does work for the movie. This part explores the lead character's journey in a different manner with added conflicts. The part surrounding him being \"The One\" reminds you of many other movies which you have already seen. Paul getting to ride 'The Worm' reminded me of Jake's Toruk Makto scene from Avatar.Everything leads to the inevitable war which has always been coming since Part One. I did like the political and relationship complexities which are weaved around the events happening at the end of the movie. But somehow the final war does not feel strong enough to leave an impact for a movie of this scale as per my opinion. I am clearly highlighting that it is my opinion considering how this movie has gained a huge fan base and positive response. I personally like Blade Runner 2049 and I feel it was more emotionally resonating. The movie is technically strong in all departments and I really don't want to waste the reader's time with my adjectives praising them. While I do like Hans Zimmer's score around Paul's character the same cannot be said about the movie throughoutDune: Part Two is a lot about its characters, most of them get a pretty strong role to play even with little screen time. Timothy as Paul Atreides is definitely tailor made for him. We definitely get to see his different shades and almost perfect character evolution from Part One to Two. Stellan Skarsg\u00e5rd as Baron is definitely one of the menacing antagonists I have seen in recent times. While Austin Butler as Feyd-Rautha has a memorable character and also play it exceptionally well, I wasn't a big fan of the character arc and depth for that role. Bautista's Rabban doesn't leave the same impact as the part one. While Christopher Walken and Florence Pugh play key roles, their roles seem like set for more to come (if at all that happens). Rebecca Feguson's as Paul's mother Jessica is probably the most complex character of the film some interesting elements to it. My favourite from this part is definitely Javier Bardem as Stilgar and his role totally changes shades as compared to Part One and also makes the movie more fun. By now most of you would have also seen all the memes around him. Josh Brolin portrays Gurney in a very strong manner but we would have loved to see some more interaction between him and Paul in this part.While Dune: Part Two is a well structured movie, it clearly benefits at the time when big studios have continuously failed to deliver on their high budget (especially superhero) projects. Dennis Villeneuve successfully manages to create an oasis for the modern cinema through a film which is almost entirely set in a desert :)", "rating": 8, "sentiment": 1, "date": "8 March 2024", "name": "sujanfaster"}

It was missing some plot elements whose absence I couldn't really fathom (especially as there was a further three hours-worth to come) but I was willing to give them a pass on that pending the second part.Saw Part 2 yesterday, truly disappointing. Important elements missed out/distorted needlessly, flaws in the details/unlikely scenarios, and clear inaccuracies in the way some things were portrayed. There was plenty of the time that was devoted to big explosions etc that could have been better used in depicting the worthwhile missing aspects of the book.Definitely not recommended.

{"id": 1063, "title": "Almost six hours and sand and still amazing", "content": "The expectations where so high, they've scraped the sealing from the floor. No matter how much time it has grown, as for the first movie runtime, I was sure it will hold well. Denis Villeneuve's work is always amazing and there was no reason for this time to be less spectacular from all his latest jobs.I went to the cinema and paid money after over a decade of getting free tickets to all the premiers, so it was an internal sign for me, and for others, regarding how I felt about the movie, before watching it, how anticipated it was and how much this movie was important to me.Lately I completed the first movie, at a second viewing, in order to remember it and be prepared. I've also started to read the book and with the distance memory of Lynch's first movie (which I watched twice and didn't like them) I was equipped properly to see the biggest event in cinemas for this calendric year.It sends out for numerous reasons - it is a movie that you must watch at the big screen. It is a cinematic event and one of few that gets the audience really exited and it live through the expectations.But...and its a big but... its doesn't live up to every expectation and it is not perfect and not deserving the mega hype it got. Not a 9, but a solid 7.5 - 8. Its perfect with all regarding the directing and cinematography. Special effects are of the chart, and you cannot expect to get what you get; vocally, if you will wait to see it indoor.Go see it on the biggest screen you can. And them the \"But\" is snicking. Because after cleaning all the background noise and how it affects the viewers, after filtering the visual impact on the viewers and after understanding the significant of this movie to the cinema as a savior and a sample of spice out of all the generic sand we get in movies lately, after all of those, we still got several important issues and problems.The characters...there are a lot of them. Not all of the characters get the appropriate treatment and though it is a very (Very!) long movie, it seems that some of them are kept as a decoration and maybe as a preparation for next chapter. Paul, Chani, Jessica and even stilgar get their fair share, but others don't evolve as much as expected.This fact effects the attachment of the viewer to the characters and to the movie as a whole. We get thrown from one character to another, without building care or affection and it is hard to develop any concern to most of the characters that get one or two sentences per half an hour.The general atmosphere of the movie is very heavy and seems as if we are not allowed to get attached to most living creatures, but need to get attached to the intoxicating elements that divides this movie from others. It causes some detachment and makes a will to appreciate the movie from a far and not get to attached to it, emotionally.And finally - the length.... almost three hours that seem to be just too much. I leave the concept of the movie as a religious conversation and other subtext and deep topics to the book to deal with. All of those are not an ideas by Villeneuve but are Frank Herbert's.I thought about the matrix so much, and how this movie is reminding the matrix, but remember that Herbert was here first and probably invented all of the rough lines for every matrix original thought. It was a lot to digest and probably will wait a little bit to see is as a mini-series, at home. A masterpiece and one that should be debated heavily for years to come.", "rating": 8, "sentiment": 1, "date": "14 March 2024", "name": "BoBo_Goal32"}
{"id": 1064, "title": "Dune: Part Two - A Visually Stunning But Slow Burn", "content": "Spice may flow freely in the desert, but the narrative in Dune: Part Two feels more like a slow sand crawl. Don't get me wrong, the visuals are breathtaking. Director Denis Villeneuve crafts a world of immense scale and captivating beauty, transporting us back to the harsh yet strangely alluring landscapes of Arrakis. From the sandblasted plains to the colossal sandworms, every frame is meticulously crafted to immerse the audience in this alien world.However, the film's pacing is undeniably slow. While the first half methodically builds the political intrigue and introduces new characters, it can feel like a slog at times. The action sequences, when they arrive, are undeniably impressive, showcasing Villeneuve's mastery of large-scale battles and special effects. But these moments are scarce, leaving the film with a distinct lack of the \"wow\" factor that captivated audiences in the first installment.Overall, Dune: Part Two is a visually stunning film that suffers from a slow-burning narrative. Fans who appreciate the director's meticulous world-building and philosophical themes will likely find themselves engrossed. But those seeking a fast-paced, action-packed blockbuster might leave the theater feeling slightly disappointed.

The world of the \"master\" turned out to be sand-empty, the characters seem completely inanimate to me, the dialogues are emotionless, deliberately pretentious, I don't see much sense in them, they are absolutely not interesting to listen to, and they only confirm the shortcomings of the work. I would describe the painting as minimalism in the void - a reflection of the inner world.Fiction is one of the most difficult and expensive genres, and Frank Herbert's novel is a real masterpiece that requires special attention.And I am well aware that to bring such a work to the screen is a huge work and beyond everyone's power, and the setting and ENT itself are tricky to perform and contain many \"pitfalls\"Villeneuve's vision and style, in my opinion, somewhat damaged the original source. The book text has been shortened and changed, which in turn affects the meaning of the story, conversations between the characters (oriental-style gibberish) seem like childish \"gibberish\", which makes them ridiculous and annoying without any benefit. It seems to me that the picture is not fully completed, the events are too compressed and leave many unanswered questions. The role of Christopher Walken in the film turned out to be quite poor and insignificant, he simply had nothing to play, and the antiheroes remained underdeveloped, unsaid, and even the most important \"villain\" faded from the narrative, Villeneuve could not come up with any intelligible arch for him, this once again shows the shortcomings of the creator, it is difficult for him to give personalities, but it is easy - images. The visual part of the work overshadowed the drama, leaving a feeling of fading and emptiness. To fully understand and analyze this picture, I will have to revise it, although I absolutely do not want to do this, because the visual style of the director in this picture turned out to be a common method that offers nothing but minimalism, contains neither meaning nor emotions, but only small images on a large empty canvas.I will conclude my lengthy discussion with the words of Leonardo da Vinci: \"Where the spirit does not lead the artist's hand, there is no art...\"", "rating": 6, "sentiment": 1, "date": "11 March 2024", "name": "magicbeamsamara"}

So Paul had done all this and all of a sudden the houses didn't like the idea that they would have a young smart and merciful ruler who most importantly had his way with Fremans and they started a holly war. Why!!??? - very simple, money, they want to turn Dune into Star Wars and milk it to the last drop, and stamp a heap of soap operas about endless and plotless Dune Wars. Well, as was planned, willy-nilly, Paul accepted the role of Neo and claimed the throne of Gondor or whatever, and like Michael Corleone killed and butchered all his enemies. There is little interest in blunt vengeance and annihilation of all one's enemies. Fighting scenes especially the last most crucial one were made very weak. If you want to see how a fight scene for the emperor's throne is done, watch the Gladiator.

{"id": 1088, "title": "A gorgeous spectacle that doesn't quite stick the landing", "content": "I've never read the books, and only watched Dune 1 the previous day when I knew I'd be seeing this in theaters. While the first instalment can be a lot to take in for a newcomer into this series like me, I felt it did a good job building the world and getting us acquainted with the characters. Even if it didn't feel like a \"complete\" movie for some.Dune Part 2 picks up any slack that the first one may have left behind. The story is faster paced, the characters become more nuanced and the politics of this universe open up to us a little more.Paul's journey to become \"the chosen one\" feels really well done and the plot allows that process to take its time. Him learning the ways of the desert, gaining the trust of the Fremen and finding love all feel organic. Him struggling with being thought of as a Messiah and wanting to help his people, but not wanting to take on the leadership role knowing what will happen if he does. And Timoth\u00e9e's acting takes on a whole new level when push comes to shove, especailly during the final act.Lady Jessica was also excellent. In the first movie I was a bit underwhelmed with her character, but as soon as she started scheming to gain power she was much more interesting and seeing that she probably never cared for Paul that much, but was merely using him is fascinating to watch. Stilgar is also hilarious, and probably the best hype man you could ever find. Feyd-Rautha had an amazing introduction as well and I was hyped to see more of him as the movie went on.This goes without saying, but this film is absolutely stunning with its visuals and sound design. Every major beat hits home hard with beautiful shots and a grand, booming score. They did a fantastic job bringing this world to life.I'd say about the first 2 hours or so are excellent and paced really well. The final act is where I had some issues. Not necessarily with what happened, but with how quickly it all transpired. After Paul drinks the Water Of Life, the shift within his character is evident. He realizes what has to be done in order to succeed(at least in his mind) and assumes the \"throne\" of the Fremen in a scene that makes your jaw drop. Chani, his girlfriend, is noticably upset by his sudden desire to lead and accept the title of Lisan Al-Gaib, and for good reason. While previously Paul had been on her side in thinking that the talk of propchecies was a waste of time it clearly isn't the case anymore. She sees that Paul loves the power, no matter how much he would want her to think otherwise.If I'm being totally honest, this is where I thought the movie would end. And that feeling came back at least a few times in different parts before the credits would actually roll. I thought we had reached the height of the story of Paul and how his clear corruption would come to be. After all, this is his story in my opinion. I was convinced we would get the rest of his rise and evident downfall in the next film. I thought that a lot of what comes after this point is, while looking and sounding awesome, just a bit rushed. The Fremen kill the Harkonnen and seize control from the Emperor. With pretty much ease. The final battle is short and a bit underwhelming in my book. Feyd-Rautha felt underutilized, I thought he would have more to do than just torture a few people and have an awesome knife fight. It's possible I need a rewatch to see if my feelings on the ending would change, but this is how I feel at the moment.Regardless, this is still an absolute spectactle that I will gladly watch again and it will definitely be talked about for years to come as the golden standard for epic Sci-Fi done right.", "rating": 9, "sentiment": 1, "date": "6 March 2024", "name": "tommihenttu"}

With amazing storytelling and music that immerses you in this sci-fi, fantazy world. The most beautiful scenery and images in every scene. And acting that just can't be complained about. But the story suffers from poor character writing in some parts.SOUNDS AND SOUNDTRACK: I saw the movie in the cinema with Dolby Surroundsound and it was one of the greatest experiences with sound i have had. Hans Zimmer made a track that is unique and fitting the genre of sci-fi, and the setting. I will definitely check out the soundtrack later.STORY AND STORYTELLING: The story fit in extremely well with its precursor and very few if any bad kliches. It was thought out, thought provoking, and emotionally provoking. There was very little i thought could have been done differently: Paul's sudden change of heart regarding being leader, felt dissatisfying as he had no inner conflict with his choices or embarassment towards Chani. The death of Rabban i thought was too fast, being done in only 3 or 4 moves, with little to no emotional satisfaction. The twist of the baron being his grandfather felt a little unasked for. But if it plays a bigger role in the third installment, it won't be a problem. And lastly the death of Feyd Rautha. I enjoyed Austin Butlers character enormesly and didnt like seeing him die. But also think that his death was very well writin and epic. I no longer see Austin Butler for his role as Elvis.THE PACING: It felt very thought through and worked well on the big screen. It really gave way for us to enjoy the stunning images, without feeling forced. Though i wanted more of Paul and Chani's chemistry, and a scene with Paul telling her about his visions of her. I think that would have shown their tight bond, and make the ending even more heart crushing.FINAL RATING: 9,3\n-Alvin Bladt 16yo.", "rating": 9, "sentiment": 1, "date": "2 March 2024", "name": "zartes"}

The mysterious Arrakis, the creepy and grey Giedi Prime. All this would be impossible without music that simply takes you to unexplored corners of the planet, Hans Zimmer and his soundtracks, as usual, fit perfectly into the picture. The actors give their best, it's hard to single out one person, because everyone tried, I'll just say that, despite the seriousness of the picture, Javier Bardem often made me laugh softly, he's cute. Separately, I would like to mention the scene where Paul refuses to kill Stilgar and proclaims himself the emperor of dune, Lisan al Gaib - these words just gave me goosebumps. The Bene Gesserit Order, its secrets and representatives are simply magnificent! Florence Pugh and Leia Seydoux are amazing! Of course, there are many discrepancies with the book canon, where the son of Paul Leto II, Alia, who should have already been born and killed Baron Harkonnen, Thufir Hawat, who simply disappeared and, of course, the character of Chani, who completely changed for the better. And, of course, I cannot ignore and praise Austin Butler, who played just a creepy psychopath, I am sure that he will go down in the history of cinema as one of the most creepy antiheroes. Rebecca Ferguson, who magically played a traitor, but still a Gesserit, struggling for her children, and Timothee Chalamet, who just feels his character and all his strength.

{"id": 1094, "title": "Sci-if Epic that, on a technical level, is nearly flawless", "content": "I think this is my first time reviewing a film in writing ever. I feel compelled to review because this film really is that compelling.Going into Dune: Part One I was green. I knew of the story, but stayed away because people said it was very dense. This always intrigued me about Dune, that it was a layered tale, but it intimidated me. When I left the theater I bought the first book and finished it quite quickly as I had a hard time putting it down. If you haven't read Frank Herbert's source material, I highly recommend you do so. You'll come away not only having read an incredibly epic tale, but an immense appreciation for Villeneuve, Frasier, Zimmer, Walker and everyone who on these films. Because you can truly see these people cared to tell a story and tell it well. You'll see not just talented people, but masters at the apex of their craft pouring not only their skills but their passion for the story of Dune.Dune 1 and 2 are a case of the right people at the right timeDune: Part Two is an epic movie and an epic moment in cinema. It will have you remembering the other pivotals moments you witnessed on the big screen: LOTR, Revenge of The Sith, The Dark Knight, just to name a few. I'm not going to say it's better than those movies, I don't think you really can, as the movies previously mentioned and others like them have cemented themselves in the folds of cinema history and the cultural zeitgeist as legends. They have earned their respect and will keep it. I'm merely stating that Dune: Part 2 will sit next them as monumental achievement.Sometimes you get movies that look really good, but the payoffs weren't as you expected. Or, some sequences were cut really well and the sound design was hitting, but as a whole the film fell flat. But, every so often you get to witness a film where all aspects are firing on all cylinders: cinematography, editing, sound design, the score, acting, pacing, writing, VFX, etc. A movie where all the pieces are meshing almost perfectly. A movie that exceeds your already high expectations and gives you goosebumps as witness something truly awesome you didn't see coming.Dune: Part Two is that movie.Now this isn't a perfect movie.It's got some pretty bad ADR in some scenes that's obvious. Some of the storytelling feels a little exposition heavy. Parts that believed could have been shown were instead told. Dune is a tough book to visualize on a screen, but still I think the verbal exposition could have been cut down. While people have said this movie has near invisible CGI/VFX, and it does, there are moments that don't look so good. Also, this isn't really a flaw, but you are not going to come away from Dune feeling like you did after watching LOTR or Star Wars. It's a different story with a different message.But the movie is EPIC. Have no confusion there. The sounds move through you. The visuals captivate you. You will be on Arrakis while watching this film. If you live near an AMC with a Dolby Cinema Room, see it there.

I'm really devastated about the direction they took Chani compared to the books. I knew something was up when they kept warning you in interviews before the movie, but this was ridiculous and just plain sad. And why make Jessica seem evil so suddenly? Why make Stilgar seem like a mockery of his character both in the first movie and in the book? This almost felt like someone else directed it or changed their perception of Dune's meaning very quickly. It felt very w o k e.I suppose the biggest letdown were the first scenes with Paul and Chani together. The cheesy porno music was a HORRIBLE choice for those scenes and could have been so much more romantic or creative. I didn't think they should have spent so much time making such a mockery of religion (even as an atheist lol), when the stories aren't just planted stories, they're actually true. Even if they're made to be true, it's still real. The audience laughed so much at the Fremen, I was insulted for them.Was it good? Yes. Will I see it 100 more times like Part I?

Part Two sees Paul Atreides, played by the veritable Timothee Chalamet, embracing his destiny as leader of the Fremen people on the desert planet of Arrakis in exile from the villainous Harkonen family who had betrayed and murdered most of his Royal family in Dune Part One to gain control of the sought after \"spice\", found only on Arrakis, which makes it possible for longer lifespans in human beings, fuel for ships, and other important uses. Or something like that, I'm just going off what I remember from Part One, having not read the book beyond like 50 or 100 pages a long time ago.Part Two depicts complications in Paul's destiny and fairly interesting changes in his character and his mother as well. It's always appreciated in this day and age to see the tried and true hero's journey subverted a bit in a big blockbuster sci-fi/fantasy epic. The acting is great all around despite the sort of cold and alien nature of all these proceedings, but the spell gradually works on the viewer and the humanity comes through, pretty much. I was surprised it ended the way it did and was expecting more of a conclusion, but there was obviously plenty of story progression and so much visual goodness to experience following Part One, which was basically perfect until the conclusion petering out. This one ends in a more rousing way, but similarly in the sense of leaving you wanting more. And I know there're multiple Dune books and maybe the first one didn't end with finality, but when I heard Part One adapted the first half of it and this the second, I had expected more of an ending, especially since a third film will be years away. I can't help but wonder if this should've been like a Game of Thrones style show, instead of a movie every few years.

The overall pacing felt a bit slow but wasn't draggy like the first and complimented the atmosphere of the film well. The movie builds tension from the start and peaks strongly towards the end, it has more action than part one. There is some lacking in the emotional resonance from some of the characters but it expands on the lore, develops the main characters and introduces new ones.The visuals were absolutely stunning. This alone sparks a collision of action and adventure in this film astronomically. The camera work constructs a world that gives a deep sense of realism. Almost every frame in this film is detailed and captivating. It's a must watch in 4K Atmos and there are several recommending this to be experienced in IMAX.The score was mesmerizing, clamorous in nature with satisfying highs and lows. Hans Zimmer's smart and vibrant composition adds a lot of weight to the film. The sound was incredible especially of the weaponry. One of the standout elements of this film is its quiet moments which bring strong emotions, pause time before metaphoric events enhanced by remarkable soundtracks and rich cinematography.Most of the characters were acceptably written. Chalament is real, Butler tries to steal the show with Zendaya, Rebecca, Skarsgard, Pugh, Walken, Bardem, Brolin all doing their parts well.Denis Villeneuve excels. He's so good in making big budget epics such as these as there are only a handful of filmmakers today that can handle this genre as skillfully as he can. Blade Runner 2049, Arrival are some of his peak filmmaking and Dune 2 comes real close to fulfillment. Raw image and sound. That's what he delivers.Dune 2 is one of the most spectacular and entertaining sci-fi sequels of the 21st century. For fantasy sci-fi fans this one's a near masterpiece.

That's why I don't feel super comfortable reviewing this movie, but I couldn't resist to make a few comments, especially about how to make adaptations.When it comes to make a movie based on someone else's vision, a filmmaker needs to be very careful where he/she has room for creative license and where he/she hasn't. If something that was written in the story looks comical on screen, that might mean the filmmaker is having difficulty understanding the writer's vision, or it might just mean that that particular thing doesn't look good on screen. Either way, I am a proponent of excluding these sort of parts, as long as it's not something crucial to the original story and the artist's vision. Of course, there are better examples of adaptations, perfect ones, like The Lord of The Rings movies. The reason I wanted to bring it up in the context of this movie in particular is because there is a contrast to this film, in the form of that old David Lynch movie. People hate me for dissing that movie and I agree that there are some interesting stuff in it, but it is nowhere near redeeming that movie. And one can also argue that Villeneuve's movie is crafted for a mainstream audience, that can also be true, but that is not an excuse for making a comical movie in my opinion, to avoid satisfying a mainstream audience, by itself, should not be the goal, nor does it justify making a comical movie...Dune: Part Two is a visually good, coherent movie. I don't think it's a masterpiece as many people claim, but it's a really good movie. I can understand the difficulties of explaining some of the concepts from the book to a mainstream audience, most of which hasn't read the book. It should have been a trilogy in my opinion, with more scenes of the characters like the Emperor, Feyd and I think Count Fenring was missing altogether, though I am not sure, maybe he was in the first one?

Particularly the scenes which felt like you're watching a teen love story at times. Retrospectively, since I watched this a week or so ago, they still do annoy me and it hurt's the rewatch I reckon. I feel as though the scenes are just filler for what's to come. It does make sense but I don't know that having the love story, and having so many scenes dedicated to it is really necessary for the audience to understand their relationship. There are better ways of doing this.For me to give this film a 10/10 there would need to be better, more visual and thought provoking interest in the scenes where they are with each other, for the first half of the film it feels like it's just about two teens in love. The entire first half of dune can feel a little slim on content because of the focus on these two. The last half makes up for it, to be clear. No doubt the lack of dialog at times is a great thing..But I still wish... anywho. 8/10.Will do a rewatch. The beauty of this film is it feels like you're in the cinemas for ages. Halfway through I didn't want to ever leave the cinema. Feels like a 5 hour film, but you get out and it's only been 3 hours! Amazing. My other gripes however is sometimes the camera cuts a little earlier than expected for a particular scene in the first half of the film. I think this was intentional rather than lazy editing, but who knows. It's a clever use of the budget to both have slim content in first half of the film then cut scenes early and to make the viewer feel like the story is always moving... you think \"oh wait we're not done looking here\" then it's already cut to the next scene.

{"id": 1127, "title": "Power over belief, is power over all", "content": "Dune 2 captures the essence of the universal dilemmas addressed by Frank Herbert, such as power, responsibility, revenge, and choices, drawing parallels with timeless human experiences. The film, centered on the concept of 'power', develops a cyclical script that anticipates Paul's deep connection with Arrakis, fluctuating between messianism and authoritarianism.Denis Villeneuve, who recently expressed in an interview his disdain for dialogue in films, delivers a powerful script that provokes reflections on messianism and establishes parallels with the current context and political figures. The first half of the movie delves into the dilemma of power and responsibility, presenting Paul as a heroic figure, deeply aware of the historical oppression suffered by the Fremen.In the second half, the transition of Paul Atreides from a Messiah to a conqueror emerges as one of the most intriguing and complex aspects of the plot. This journey, filled with nuances, reflects the tension between destiny and choice, as well as the ethical and moral implications of his decisions. As Paul takes on his role and exercises his power, his trajectory becomes darker, transforming his messianic leadership into a stance of a military conqueror. Thus, the Fremen, previously exploited by outsiders for their planet and resources, now see their faith being manipulated. In this context, faith reveals itself as the true source of power manipulated by Paul, who reassumes his role not as a Fremen, but as a Duke, reinforcing the cyclical structure of the narrative.Paul's rise to power unveils a harsh truth: power corrupts, and the line between the pursuit of justice and authoritarianism becomes blurred. Paul Atreides, oscillating between veneration and fear, becomes a fascinating character study on leadership and sacrifice.", "rating": 9, "sentiment": 1, "date": "5 March 2024", "name": "aleffengineer"}

After watching The King, I compared him to a young Al Pacino - and then he basically flew off my radar since.I didn't like any of his subsequent roles, including as Paul Atreides in Dune, which is a film I found to be artfully made but, like most other Denis Villeneuve films, lacking something that touches me.I wasn't going to see Dune 2, except that I did. It was as everyone else said - epic, sweeping, complex, and well-made in all aspects. Having said that, it is Timoth\u00e9e who truly defines this film as a much more complex Paul Atreides, representing both the best and worst of messiah fervor. He reminds me of Henry V in The King, except with more charisma, maturity and a darkness that hides deeper. Everyone else in the film, with perhaps the exception of Zendaya, impresses and matches Timoth\u00e9e's lead.Now, having read through enough information, I understand that if Messiah is made, that the storyline may entail Paul's downfall. Dune and Dune 2 may not be as significant to the world of cinema as The Godfather Part 1 and Part 2, but Dune: Messiah has the setup to surpass the final chapter of The Godfather.This time, we may truly witness the epic transformation of a man from hero to god to destroyer, reminiscent of a Greek tragedy, offering a potentially unparalleled exploration of power and its consequences.", "rating": 9, "sentiment": 1, "date": "4 March 2024", "name": "utp0130"}

{"id": 1131, "title": "Power Filmmaking, with the Occasional Lack of Spice", "content": "Dune: Part II picks up immediately where the first film ended. It's a straight continuation of Part I and therefore doesn't necessarily have a standout identity of its own (like a Star Wars, or Harry Potter film), which is a perfect approach to it given that both films are basically two halves of one book.It's an epic follow-up, a mastery of filmmaking, imagery, ambience, sound and all sorts of technicalities. You can't help but feel mesmerised by what you are seeing and hearing, and its sense of wonder is unmatched when compared to most films nowadays.The acting in general is superb - but more on that later. The film feels a bit sluggish at times though, and maybe it could have been shortened for pacing purposes. One of Dune - Part II's biggest drawbacks is the lacklustre chemistry between Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet and Zendaya, which makes the Paul/Chani dynamic not very interesting or believable. In fact, Zendaya gives an extremely wooden performance and is clearly outacted by everyone else. She brings down the scenes she is in and her acting seems like it would be more appropriate in a teen flick than in the epic story that is being told here; she lacks nuance, versatility and presence and one wonders if she was cast mainly due to appeal to her social media followers as opposed to any acting prowess. It's not as apparent in the first film as she barely does have anything to do there, but here it's painstakingly obvious and Villeneuve mistankingly focussed much of the second film on her, and she isn't able to carry it. Chalamet is very good, but he sounds at times perhaps too american (same for Zendaya), as if you could pinpoint where he comes from, thus breaking the illusion a bit - it would have been great if a dialect coach had been hired to neutralise their accents, speech patterns and inflections a bit.Aesthetically the film is top notch, though Florence Pugh's looks are a bit questionable at times, especially the first one as it looks more like she is in New York Fashion Week than in an alien world. On the other hand, everything about Feyd-Rautha is fantastic and his scene in the arena is hypnotic, rivalling the iconic one in Gladiator. However, his final clash with Paul Atreides at the end of the film isn't that much better than the one in the 1984 film, and you can't help but think that it could have been more climatic given everything else that preceded it.Dune: Part II proves again that Dennis Villeneuve is one of the best filmmakers ever and after Arrival, Blade Runner 2049, Dune: Part I and now Part II back to back you can't help but anxiously wait for whatever it is he comes up with next!Part I is slightly better mostly due to pacing and perhaps the part of the story being told, but there is no doubt that Dune: Part II is unmissable and one of the greatest sci-fi films of all-time.", "rating": 8, "sentiment": 1, "date": "4 March 2024", "name": "DavidOrpheus"}

The performances, the music, the visuals, the sound design, the worldbuilding, the props, the story, I love everything. Not a scene, word or frame feels out of place. Every speck of sand feels immaculately placed. Cons? There are none. I would not change a single thing. Denis Villeneuve has achieved his dream and the dream of many other filmmakers before him. The visuals are unforgettable but the film is also filled with substance, emotion, gravitas, romance and even humor. Javier Bardem in particular is so wonderful to watch on screen that I would consider him for a best supporting actor award. The whole rest of the cast also delivers near career best performances. Austin Butler is a revelation as the sadistic but complex Feyd Rautha. Josh Brolin and Dave Bautista are everything you want them to be and more. Souheila Yacoub lit up the screen. Rebecca Ferguson is equal parts terrifying and enchanting. Zendaya has never been better. Timothee Chalamet cements his place as one of the best actors of his generation, playing one of the most complex characters in all of science fiction and nailing every nuance. He absolutely commands the screen.This film is like a moving painting, utterly gorgeous. Completely spellbinding. I didn't want to leave Arrakis at the end.

From the vast sand seas of Arrakis to the majestic sandworms, every frame is a visual feast. The score, once again by Hans Zimmer, perfectly complements the visuals, heightening the film's emotional core.While \"Dune: Part Two\" may not be a perfect film, it is a significant achievement in filmmaking.

The protagonist's mother is written as incredibly annoying, the villains are underused, Florence Pugh's character has 0 likability and acts simply as a story device. Bardem's character is OK and funny at times and Brolin doesn't have a standout moment. Zendaya's character is the sole exception to this, who is the beating heart of the film.At times, I also felt that Chalamet, despite being an amazing actor, is perhaps miscast, though having not read the material, I cannot comment further on this.The pacing felt off, as it stays too long in places it shouldn't, while sacrificing moments that could linger longer. This coming from a person that enjoys long epics and slow burn films. The movie looks outstanding though feels closer to a connection of rushed story beats. The direction it takes with the main character also does not feel earned.Perhaps the second biggest issue is that I do not totally buy into the world that has been created. It feels large but empty and lacking character. Almost too clean and strange for the sake of it. Style over substance. We stay for most of the time in one or two places which doesn't help. There were also some weird choice of cuts and jumps in scenes that hampered the flow of the film.With that said, there are a couple of epic moments that stood out, which are 1) the whole Zendaya bazooka scene and 2) the giant worm riding.Overall, the film is enjoyable.

Thus, she doesn't kill Baron H.Shani does not have the twins nor is she pregnant with them.The aspect of the hidden, poisoned blade in the fight with Rautha is central to that scene.Paul does not manage his marriage of convenience to the Emperor's daughter, but drops Shani.Shani is left to be the woman fighter alone (hopefully not pregnant) which is such a trending trope nowadays. Angry young woman of color, hitting the marketing demographics, ready for the next installment. Very salable, did the studio require those storyline changes ? Please. And PS Alia is a notably more interesting character than Shani, regardless of what color they both are. Make one blue and the other orange in episode 3.What's missing is the subtlety of Herbert's story: the power of the story is precisely because of the mystical aspects of Jessica, Paul and Alia's characters. Because they take their BG training and background and use it freely outside of the constraints of the sociopolitical order, and thus are more powerful than that order. Paul is not a worldly Mahdi, but becomes a new type of human. Power is subtle, as is Herbert's story. This reduces it to a focus on material power, with brutality being defeated by butchery. Very salable given the tone of the times, but the tone of the times blows, and you had 2.5hrs to put the real story on the screen, which would have been a mind-broadening experience for the masses suffering under the tone of the times.

There is so much packed into this movie that having the back story down before viewing will add to your enjoyment. The cinematography is beyond anything I've ever seen on the screen. The word \"sweeping cinematography\" comes to mind but that doesn't portray how breathtaking it all was. BIG shout outs to Rebecca Ferguson, Austin Butler, Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet and Zendaya for their acting. By the way, the hand-to-hand fight scene between Butler and Chalamet is exceptionally choreographed and must have taken many weeks of rehearsal (usually, I'm yawning at fight scenes). I want to go back and watch this movie 4 or 5 more times to make sure I gleaned all possible nuance. They could have split this movie into two feature films and we'd still had an overwhelming amount to unpack. I've heard that there is incredible scenes which were left on the cutting room floor.

While it starts off with the same tone and pacing with Paul and his mom mixing with the Fremen people, it shifts to Paul leading the Fremen while his mom goes south to sew belief in Paul as their Messiah. Paul wins over the Fremen people and this is where the pacing and cut scenes become a bit of a mess. Parts of the movie pick up, while other parts move at a snails pace. Scenes of Paul and the Fremen people attacking the Harkonnens come and go so quickly that it becomes difficult to enjoy them. The background of the Harkonnen planet and the Baron's nephew are slow and seem unnecessary. Not sure an exposition on how terrible the Harkonnen and the Baron's nephew are necessary after we came to know them from the first movie. The movie then significantly speeds up and cut scenes are more rapid and short. This causes pacing issues. Once Paul heads south the movie becomes a bit of a mess. One scene he's on a worm heading south, then he's running into the temple drinking worm juice and becoming poisoned, then Chani flies in on an ornithopter, it happens so fast the audience may mistake it for one of his visions. Where did they get an ornithopter? When did Chani learn to fly one? Why is Paul running into the temple? The pacing and cutting is so fast it becomes rushed, which is directly opposite of the first half of the movie. The final battle happens so fast it's hard to enjoy it. It just becomes such a rushed mess that it almost feels like a cliff notes version of what really happens. There is little to no involvement of Paul and Chani at the end of the movie. It almost feels as if they should have done yet another movie to give us more action and backstory on Paul's relationship with his mother while in the south, and his relationship with Chani before the end. The revenge scenes fall flat due to the fast pacing and lack of build up.

{"id": 1179, "title": "Excellent film, but", "content": "I'm giving this film a 10 out of 10. I think both parts together amount to a 9.5 overall and I gave a 9 to part 1. But as a book fan I feel frustrated.The film, as a film, is excellent. A true work of art that has everything we can ask of an epic movie: great characters, great plot, a satisfying conclusion, epic action scenes, mystical and ominous scenes, etc. On top of that, the visual aspect and the soundtrack are extraordinary. It's one of those movies that is at the same time a work of art and has mass appeal. Watch it in the best cinema you can because the cinema experience really is different from the TV experience at home.As a book fan, though, I'm frustrated. I know Denis Villeneuve had an extremely difficult task. This book is notoriously difficult to adapt. And he was probably very frustrated by the things he had to leave out as well.So I can't judge him harshly except on one thing: he refuses to make extended cuts. I understand that stance when it comes to normal movies but when adapting iconic books that stance is not tenable. And there's great precedent with the Lord of the Rings trilogy. Dune is an extraordinary film as such, but as an adaptation I can't say it's extraordinary. So I absolutely think he should work on extended cuts after finishing Dune Messiah.Specifically I am frustrated by the absence of mentats, especially of Tufir Hawat, the absence of Count Fenring, and of the navigators. Not to mention many subplots and scenes but I understand time is limited. Most people are going to have a problem with Alia but I'm ok with what Villeneuve did because it's nearly impossible to adapt her well anyway. I thought what he did with Alia was ingenious and fascinating in its own way.But I am especially frustrated with the portrayal of Lady Jessica. I was forgiving of Part 1's flaws in her portrayal but now that I've seen part 2 I'm actually disappointed with how she was basically made a villain in part 2. I understand the need to emphasise that the Bene Gesserit are the great manipulators of politics in Dune but Lady Jessica was also a rebel against the Bene Gesserit. She was more good than evil, much like Paul and his father. Yet in the movies she's too emotional in part 1 and too manipulative/villainous in part 2.Finally, for the unpopular opinion. I understand not liking Zendaya, but I think people's dislike of her is blinding them to Chani's character. I thought she did have chemistry with Paul. I thought Villeneuve did a good job fleshing out Chani because she's a bit one dimensional in the books. I understood why she stormed out of the room at the end, she was publicly humiliated and hurt by Paul. However I thought the last scene was not the best to end on. It's understandable and supposed to represent not only Chani's personal pain, but also the pain of people who were rooting for Paul to be able to avoid the holy war and instead watch him transform into someone different. Yet it's not the best scene to end this epic on.But overall I loved the movie, I can't wait for Dune Messiah, and I really hope Villeneuve changes his mind about extended cuts.", "rating": 10, "sentiment": 1, "date": "3 March 2024", "name": "bindhu-57155"}

{"id": 1197, "title": "it'll all depend on whether you want an adaptation or not", "content": "I wasn't a huge fan of the first part. As a big fan of the books, I thought that they didn't really do enough to build the lore or develop the characters. I thought they concentrated on the wrong elements of the book.I was willing to give the 2nd part a fair chance to correct that. Get things back on track. Its supposed to be an adaptation and part of me does expect the general spirit of the characters to be maintained, even if some of the detail wasnt.Book fans may be disappointed. The writer and director take liberties with the source material, fundamentally changing the nature of a main character. If jars as a book fan to see how they treated Chani. Not only that, but it also makes further Dune movies likely to deviate even further from the source.*spoilers*It was a common complaint that Chani was.little used in the first part of the adaptation. Zendaya appeared fleetingly and had almost no significant input into things. Clearly that's not the case in part 2, but her part in the story is significantly different from the original source.In part 2, Chani seems to switch between loving Paul to telling anybody who'll listen that he's not the messiah and is instead somewhat of a naughty boy. It makes the intimate, romantic stuff seem out of place against her continued effort to undermine the prophecy that he's the voice from another world who'll lead the Fremen to freedom. The 2 sides to Chani really do jar against each other. The romance never feels particularly genuine when she seems to switch from lover to critic in the space of a few minutes of run time.Should that matter? For the movie it possibly doesnt, other than being annoying. But this is the girl who's supposed to be the mother of 3 children to Paul. So to have her storm out of the scene with Princess Irulan and to then end the film with the spurned lover calling a worm to ride alone into the desert has a far bigger negative impact. Book readers know what Chani's role should be. We know what she does in Dune Messiah and how things play out in Children. If there is going to be an adaptation of the 2nd, and maybe even 3rd, books in Herbert's series then Dune part 2 hasn't exactly made it easy to get things back on track. Paul is going to have to do some pretty incredible making up if he;s going to convince the rather detached Chani to be the mother of his kids in time for a potential Messiah adaptation.It's not all bad. The cinematography is great. The sound is fantastic. The scene with Paul addressing the council of naibs is genuinely incredible. His snarling performance in front of his doubters, almost inviting them to challenge him before destroying any of their doubts with his deeply personal knowledge of their history and their ways is one of the finest scenes in recent cinema. Chalamet plays the scene perfectly. Sadly the rest of the movie can't quite reach that high point. The final battlle for Arakeen feels a good few minutes shorter than it should be. The Harkonen character design never feels particularly well done and Beast Raban is more pantomime villain than the guy sent to brutalise the Arakis population.Does any of that matter? If I'd never read the original source material then it probably wouldn't. I'd be a little bit unsure of the character development but I'd probably feel that most of the constituent parts of an epic scifi classic were there. It's a flawed movie, but those flaws probably wouldn't be such an issue as they are for me as a fan of the books.Ultimately the director and writer have told their version of the Dune novel over 2 movies. It's just that the character changes not only fail to help the movie, but they flat out detract from it and it ends up feeling like a wasted opportunity.

That is first. For what cinema can do with the tools that the present offers. Dune: Part 2 is an attempt that, by far, hits more than it misses. But it misses. And where it suffers is in the story, in the structure of the narration.It seems almost ridiculous to say that what a nearly three-hour film needed was more time. But it's the case. And the initial development of the plot (for pragmatic reasons I presume, every director has to cut things) has a somewhat hasty evolution. Everything at the beginning is presented and developed almost immediately: Paul is questioned by the Fremen, 15 minutes later accepted and shortly after adored. His training in this unforgiving desert is not far from an Instagram reel in terms of exposition. Fremen culture is portrayed almost superficially (the Sardaukar a meme). The great distances that this people had to cross are received almost as a comment; because from one scene to another they have already done it. And because of all this, the narration then loses a bit of emotional effect.Still, it's a good adaptation of the story: from the hand of a cast that justifies their names with unquestionable performances, and from what the director did with what he had (the time at his disposal; the script had to be fitted), Dune: Part 2 manages to sustain itself narratively and portray the essence of what inhabits.Now, where it shines. The cinematography. The sets, the costumes. The photography, the sound, the practical and digital effects taken to the limits of their capabilities by people with vision. If the film is narratively an 8, audiovisually it's a 10. After seeing it in IMAX I can say that the phrase that is already becoming a clich\u00e9 (\"Dune: Part 2 in IMAX is insane\"); Yes, it's a clich\u00e9, but it's also true.

In the first movie, we can feel that Saudakar soldiers are very feared, unmatched in strength but in this sequel, the fermen make it look easy to kill them. I don't get it. In first movie you make them look strong but in the sequel they look weak. Third, the final battle between the fremen and the emperor seems ordinary and not epic, unlike the war in the first movie when atredis fight harkonen.The sequel is good but it lacks the epicness of the first movie.", "rating": 7, "sentiment": 1, "date": "1 March 2024", "name": "assyo"}

{"id": 1211, "title": "great I you didn't read the books", "content": "Short spoiler-free version:\nA was really looking forward to this movie. Having read the books multiple times, I left the cinema feeling cheated en confused. Granted the visuals and the music are astounding. The actors perform very well and the story is fine if haven't read the books. And there's the problem. I you, like me, have read the book you will be thinking 'why?' every 10 minutes or so. Villeneuve has made so many changes to the story, I hardly recognize it as Dune anymore. And that makes me sad. I try to view the movie and the book as separate things. But how many changes can one make in the story before it deviates to much? After all it is a movie adaptation of the book, there should be enough of it you can recognize. In this the director has, sadly, mist the marc.After the movie I kept sitting staring as the credits rolled by, I was the last one to leave an I felt cheated and sad. My advice is, If you love the books, wait for the streaming services to pick it up. If you haven't read the books, go an see it, you'll love it although perhaps it might be a bit long for your taste.Longer version (spoilers!)\nSo, what went wrong? Is do understand that you have tot make some choices in what you keep en leave out in the story when making a story. You merge some characters, leave some out. Delete scenes that a nice but not really necessary in the main plotline. (like the banket-scene in the first movie). But Villenueve and the writers have made al lot of changes that impact the story in so much that is totally deviates from the book. As a fan I can not get my head around soms of them:\nChani is not supporting at all of Paul, she is mostly angry and against all that Paul wants tot do. The actors try there best but I miss the chemistry from the previous adaptations and the books. In the ending there is no 'we are concubines' scene. Chani leaves Paul and rides out in the dessert. Why?Jessica in the books is a strong well trained Bene Gesserit. In the movie she goes from a weak, sniveling, manipulative woman. Not the strong reverent mother who takes care of het people en supports Paul and grows closer tot Chani. I can't understand why.Stilgar in the books is a strong and wise leader who teaches Paul and gradually gives him his trust. In the movie he is transformed into an religious zealot from the South of Arrakis, were all Fremen blindly believe in the prophecy. (In the north the Fremen are non-believers, essentially making it 2 different tribes of Fremen, again why?).And then there is no mention of the ecological theme, instead of the water of life they threaten with nukes on the spicefields, no spicing guild and a feeble weak emperor (poor Christhoper Walken, he tries))\nI can get why Feyd is changed into a psychopath (not much change from the books) and why Hawat and Alia are left out completely (sad but understandable). But the rest? As I stated, I feld robbed, sad and very disappointed.

{"id": 1215, "title": "Thank you Frank & Dennis", "content": "I want to preface this review by saying my favorite type of story in any show, movie or game will always be \"The chosen one\" plot.These are my thoughts on Dune Part 2 and Dune so far as a whole.Everything about this movie was everything I wanted it to be and more. I went into this movie never reading the book or looking up anything about what happens after dune part 1. There were at least 3 scenes in the first hour of the movie I kept thinking to myself \"how can it possibly get better\" and it literally just kept getting better. The acting was unreal by everybody (even Zendaya who I am personally not a big fan of, I think she's boring and doesn't have a good range of emotion in her acting) I haven't seen much of Timothee Chalamet outside of the two Dune movies but he was unbelievable in Part 2. I can't really put into words how his acting moved me besides using the word perfection. The side character casting of this movie was just as spectacular as the plot. Austin Butler (in my opinion) couldn't have done a better job at playing Feyd-Rautha. The scene with him that really stood out to me was when Paul killed Baron and the camera pans over to Feyd-Rautha and he genuinely looked like he was enjoying it with zero feeling behind his eyes while licking his lips as if he was turned on by the death of his uncle. That's the perfect depiction of evil in my opinion. Moving on to Christopher Walken, the first few lines of his I felt a little disappointed because I pictured the Emperor to be a more king like character speaking very properly and with an accent. In the final act of the movie I ended up really liking the fact that they let Christopher Walken essentially play himself. I've definitely been a Florence Pugh fan since I saw the movie Midsommer in theaters and thought the minimal lines she had in this movie were also great.The cinematography by Grieg Fraser was nothing short of beautiful. Every single wide shot of the movie had my jaw on the floor.The dialogue of this movie was probably my favorite part of the entire experience. From the funny moments to almost every line Timothee Chalamet had after waking up from drinking the water of life.After seeing so many comments about the first Dune movie on TikTok or instagram of people saying \"I fell asleep during the first movie\" or \"it was so boring\" I rewatched trying to figure out how people felt that way because the first time I watched part 1 I couldn't stop thinking about how good of an introduction to such a complex world it was. I rewatched it a 3rd time on a Friday with my girlfriend before going to see part 2 on Sunday. Part 1 was exactly what I wanted from a part 1 of any franchise. I recently rewatched all of Star Wars and LOTR a month before dune Part 2 came out to see how it would stack up against these movies and I can honestly say I liked Part 1 better than a New Hope and fellowship of the ring by a pretty big margin. The way you get so many different aspects of a story thrown at you at once was definitely a tall task but the way it was explained and showed to the audience was nearly perfect.Immediately after watching Part 2 I thought to myself wow that movie was so good it made Part 1 look bad. But as I digested the movie the next day it gave me an even bigger appreciation for the first one and how well it set up the second movie.Every time I watch a movie and end up enjoying it a lot I always think to myself \"have I ever seen something like that before\" to try and curb my recency bias.The answer is no. There's truly nothing out there like Dune Part 2 and I can honestly say it was the best movie sequel, as well as the best movie I've ever seen.10/10.", "rating": 10, "sentiment": 1, "date": "4 March 2024", "name": "jtmfrgxck"}

There is also a lot of talking in this movie and not much action, basically action scenes are over quickly and there isn't much buildup to the last battle which again is over so ridiculously quickly and all the duels also are over so quick so I just couldn't immerse myself or feel the significance of things happening on screen because it was like a speed run of many events which I hate.

This movie absolutely delivers more of that fantastic cinematography that is so thoughtfully shot with natural lighting using the desert sun at various times of day and angles. It's immersive and just an incredible feat of filmmaking. While other fantastic sequels like Empire really offer a dramatic change of scenery and costumes for our main characters (eg. Hoth, Cloud City), this sequel mostly takes place in the same place. But instead of just feeling like more of the same it builds on what the first film introduced, revealing more detail about the Fremen's underground dwellings and places of worship and taking us to the southern part of the planet. We see more of the Harkonnen home world and get a better taste of that blood-thirsty culture. Austin Butler's character introduces us to someone new, interesting, and frightening. Paul and Jessica's evolution throughout this movie from the end of the first film to the end of this one leave us in a very different place with their characters. And (having myself not read the book) some of the plot twists we learn about are reminiscent of the great plot twists in Star Wars, which made the inspiration Dune had on George Lucas even more apparent. The movie is long, but I often found myself hoping it wouldn't end where I thought it might and it kept going until giving us a very satisfying epic battle and full development of the characters to set the stage for the third film.

It seriously blew the first film out of the water in every way with how good it was. Dennis Villeneuve is quickly becoming one of my favorite directors. On an unrelated note, I watched Enemy and Incendies by him last week with the latter being particularly great. Sicario along with Dune: Part 2 is also one of my favorite movies, which the same director did also. Anyways, back to the spectacle. No spoilers but they did a cool Easter egg reference if you've seen Blue Velvet (my favorite movie of all time), since David Lynch directed the first version of Dune. The first movie I thought was great, but you'd have to be a fan as it was a little slower. That one really felt like the prologue, but this was the real deal. Dune: Part 2 was consistently intense on the action front and truly a masterclass work. It certainly doesn't hurt that Zendaya, Christopher Walken, and Javier Bardem are all among my favorite actors.

I loved it.But like the first movie, this one is held back from true greatness by Hollywood's commercial obsession with shortening run-times.Later half of the movie strips away massive chunks of the original story, oversimplifying or even completely omitting characters, events and conflicts. It felt rushed, abrupt, unresolved, unexplained and lacking in payoff.So I really hope Mr Villeneuve has stashed away all of these stripped-out components of both movies, for an 8-9 hours long complete Director's Cut.

Stunning cinematography, and the soundscape is extremely well composed.But, what is has in spades on the technical front, it severely lacks on other fronts. Unlike the prequel, this movie takes several departures from the book, most of which I'm not entirely sure why, and some seems downright uncharacteristic. As an example, Chani's disbelief in the prophecy. I get that the persuasion of the Fremen is a key in the story, and this is a way to highlight it further, but her being in love with Paul, and then not believing in him or supporting him at all, at times directly disrespecting him, seems very irrational.In general, the characters felt shallow and I had no engagement in them whatsoever. I don't think Timothee Chalamet was well cast as Paul. Acting was overall decent, but there somehow was something missing in terms of character depth and development. I think it comes down to the pacing of the movie. Example when Paul needs to learn to ride the worms, one scene is Stilgar telling him it requires a lot to master, next scene is literally Paul riding the biggest worm they have ever seen.The storytelling also completely fails to convey the complexity of the political system, the role of spice, and how each player tries to take advantage.In the end, a grand attempt at translating a classic book, that ultimately falls short on character depth/development and overall storytelling.

It's a good movie, but I wouldn't say it's a masterpiece or anything of that nature. To me, this film is absolutely spectacular on a technical level. The gorgeous cinematography, impeccable sound, and Hans Zimmer's magnetic score are the highlights in that department. But what really lets the film down for me is the story. It's just too slow with little satisfying payoff to make up for it. We get to see Paul integrate into life with the Fremen and slowly embrace his role as the Messiah, but even by film's end, the development of his ascendancy doesn't feel earned to me. Another issue I have is how the film's villains are handled. The Harkonnens are given very little to do and are ultimately disposed of rather swiftly. Even Feyd Rautha, who has received heaps of praise, doesn't really do that much despite an impressive first impression. I just wish, in my honest opinion, we got more out of what Part One set up, but by this film's end, the result feels hollow. Now to keep this review from sounding too negative, I'll end by saying I think the cast and Denis did the best with what they were given, but this feels too constrained and anticlimactic to feel wholly satisfying. For better or worse, my opinion on this film could change on a rewatch like it did for Part One. Likewise, I'm sure the book will change my opinion once I read it.

David Lynch was closer in one, 137-minute-long movie. The 1st part was not this awful (they ensured the geeks would buy tickets for part 2). Missing parts go much deeper compared to part one, and ruining the original story.Villeneuve's vision, while visually grand, sacrifices the core of Herbert's universe. The politics, the spice-fueled conspiracies, and the complex spirituality of the Fremen are flattened into spectacle. Key character motivations are lost; what should resonate as profound moments come off as melodramatic or simply confusing. Some key character are fully missing!Where Part One at least flirted with the novel's mystique, Part Two abandons it. The subtleties of power struggles, the undercurrents of messianic prophecy... instead, we get endless battles and bombastic set pieces. Gorgeous, sure, but like the desert of Arrakis itself: beautiful yet ultimately devoid of the life that made Dune so captivating.If these 2 films are your introduction to Dune, you've missed the point entirely. Herbert's work was about environmentalism, the dangers of chosen ones, and the intersection of religion and power. Villeneuve's film is a blockbuster in Dune clothing, appealing to the lowest common denominator rather than honoring the source material.A missed opportunity, and a disappointment for those who love Frank Herbert's masterpiece.", "rating": 1, "sentiment": 0, "date": "6 March 2024", "name": "zoltantakacs-76071"}

(2) Epic scenes like Paul's worm riding. (3) Art, costume and set design. (4) The constant reminder of the self-fulfilling nature of the prophecy.

And finally, (7) although Denis being called humorless, there are quite a few funny moments in this movie!Bad things: (1) the story being so dense and long, Denis and his editing team has had to cut some expectedly epic scenes into shorter fleeting less-than-memorable moments - all Harkonnen deaths, barring the last one, are good examples of such. (2) Rushed pacing in the final third hour of the movie, that left a rather jarring effect of the storytelling on me. (3) Extremely unbelievable dialog delivery by Chalamet and rushed ascendency of Paul in assuming his messianic destiny among the southern Fremen.

Feeling like the film is a documentary due to the realism of the scenes. Costume design and locations are integral.Am I exaggerating in my assessment?I don't believe so. I feel that this film will be one of the most important films in history. A masterpiece that will increase in stature over time.Tip:For maximum enjoyment, I recommend watching \"Dune Part II\" on the biggest screen possible, preferably in IMAX cinema. This experience will allow you to enjoy the stunning visual effects and wonderful soundtrack even better.", "rating": 10, "sentiment": 1, "date": "1 March 2024", "name": "aseif-41951"}

{"id": 1251, "title": "Good solid sequel, but missed potential.", "content": "I came out slightly disappointed on the film. Not because it is bad, at all. It is a solid film, a good sci fi movie, entertaining and rewatchable. However, I have these points in my mind that make wonder: why is that happening? How is that working?If you watched Dune part 1 it masterfully adapts the first half of Dune novel. It is not perfect either, but I believe it is way better and will age much better than the sequel.The second part starts where the first one finished, but takes another 2h to build to the final climax. They are 2 very entertaining hours, to be honest, and the story isn't bad. However, it felt like many of the elements he build during the first film and tried to build in this second were falling apart by the end.What was a justificable lack of logical thought in small skirmishes and a traitorous attack in the first film fighting scenes becomes all too obvious in the second part, to the point that most of the fight or strategy is kind of pointless and becomes evidently a trade off between temporal entertaining and good scripting. Sadly the first one is favored. For example:Why do they do close range attacks in the spice harvester machines and then bomb it from afar?Why didn't were shelled with artillery and attacked heavily from the beginning by the Harkonnen?And the final battle is tactically stupid, considering you are an intergalactic empire... they don't have air support? They put all their men together at the entry of their fortress? How the Great Houses came to Haroknned in a matter of hours? I know the book is similar in some of the fighting decisions and logic, but things are explained and have more logic (with a more solid backstory). In the film, there are several plot holes. And the final battle barely felt like anything. There wasn't any challenge, any tension, any difficulty...In any case, the lack of logic in fight scenes was probably a minor fault. My main complain would be sacrificing the depth of Paul's evolution as a character to have Chani (Zendaya's character) take a bigger role. The story wasn't lacking female characters (Paul's mother, Jessica, is very well developed and fleshed out), and the emotion between Paul and Chani doesn't really resonate, it doesn't really feel like it has any chemistry, the mistery we felt they had between then in the first film is gone in sake of modernizing Chani's character and doesn't really work. This takes also time from Paul's evolution, that ends up feeling rushed and incoherent, and less interesting that it should be.I understand they wanted to give the Fremen more of a personal voice, and specially to Chani, as a unique version of an opressed people and not being a fanatical one at it. But precisely because you are taking the focus away from the collective aspect and trying to add more nuances to it, that at some points feels forced, everything becomes diluted and less meaningful. When you have the Fremen separated between fanatical and unbelivers, and that happening to identify with old males for the first group and young female and males for the second one, without giving a reason why, it kind feels like a forced identification with current social issues that don't really make that much sense in the fictional world that they are showing us.Currently Chani feels like too overbearing without much to tell (how many shots of her with an angry face have we seen by the end of the film?), and takes much needed time away from Paul's development (yes, he is still the main character, remember?), from the Emperor (which doesn't feel like he has any importance at all), from the Fremen in general (it would've been great having mor of Stilgar, that is acted really well and that could give the public more insight into the Fremen), the Harkonnen (that besides the arena scene, are mostly treated as incompetent) or the rest of the politics that a galatic empire would have (and that are well written in the book) and would give much more cohesion to the whole narrative.I felt they had a good base with the book to create something incredible, and indeed at some points they did streamlined and polished what the book had, but in other they really didn't improve it, but made it worse. This could be better with a Director's Cut, adding more time and scenes to Paul, the Fremen and the Harkonnen, the politics..", "rating": 7, "sentiment": 1, "date": "8 March 2024", "name": "david_divm"}

I think this is related to the fact that the first \"Dune\", both for Denis and for the audience, was a film that merely introduced us to this world. \"Dune 2\", on the other hand, is already something more familiar for Denis and for us. However, this film never ceases to amaze. Every scene is endowed with remarkable visual narration in one form or another. There is always some aspect, detail, that adds to the world of \"Dune\" and allows it to be revealed from different angles. This film, for me, is what cinema is capable of in terms of visuals - it manifests imagination into reality, allowing us to see imagination without imagining, thanks the wonderful team that worked on this film and Denis Villeneuve himself.Having been familiar with the book \"Dune\", I want to say that in my opinion, Denis and the screenwriters successfully conveyed the idea of \"Dune\". I may not be the first to say this, but the book itself is somewhat dry, considering its writing style. However, the idea of faith that Herbert embedded in the book makes this story not only about the planet Arrakis and Paul Atreides but also about the human spirit. Indeed, the film very clearly conveys this idea, making it a spiritual experience.I believe Denis Villeneuve will make the final, third film something unforgettable.", "rating": 8, "sentiment": 1, "date": "3 March 2024", "name": "oleh_holodyshyn"}

{"id": 1280, "title": "Dune: Part Two - Truly, \"The Messiah of Cinema\".", "content": "How could you define the word \"Cinema\"? Maybe I won't be able to, because cinema is not just about words; it's a thing to feel, experience, and immerse in it. The beauty of cinema is a visual fascination that no other thing could yield. The art of light and sound is practically orchestrated to create imagery that gives life to your creativity and imagination.I'm speechless in front of this cinema that's beyond the masterpiece. Greatest theatrical experience. A filmmaking masterclass that is extraordinary, like never seen before in history, would be unforgettable for the ages to come. Honorable regard for Denis Villeneuve, the one who made it possible. We were not prepared for this.Some may feel the world of Dune is shallow, inempathetic, and unresonating, or that it's too slow, but indeed, none of them is reasonable until, you yourself experience Dune's masterclass in filmmaking. Dune Part Two appears to have ended abruptly, but it made every effort to reach deep into its roots. The sequel's pacing is a bit faster than the first one, the subtlety is slightly compromised this time but still it doesn't lose its own flow. The film doesn't spend its wisdom on each and every character like Paul Atreides, each character gets a luminescent screen presence, and it's an admiration to be a part of such an epic adventure led by a great cinematic vision. It is undeniably a staggering achievement in the art of filmmaking. Even the big-budgeted films like Star Wars, Lord of the Rings, Avatar, Avengers: Endgame would be jealous of this spectacle and fall in love with Dune: Part Two. Next year, Dune: Part Two will sweep the highest number of Oscars nominations for sure (biggest contender).The desert, sandworms, spice in the air, and sheer beauty of a desolated planet known as Arrakis make us fall in love with it. Dune Part Two is a rare kind of film that we don't usually get to experience. This how a better sequel is made. I don't know how much I love this film, it's limitless and timeless. The love story of Dune and me would go on to infinity. I don't know how the craft of filmmaking was this better, evolved, and indeed achieved its greatest feat. Each aspect is constituted with acute wisdom by each field of work. Director, Denis Villeneuve gives his mind, body, soul, and heart to this franchise. This genius is behind the whole world-building and precipitating us into its land of sand. The visual effects and cinematography are like an oasis in the desert. The star-studded cast quenched our thirst. Hans Zimmer's background score is a companion on our journey. The enormous set designs and costumes embellish them, whereas the sand particles sometimes turn into sandstorms, especially when Harkonnen's shadow falls on the land. House of Atreides is a fallen kindom, but our journey is with Paul Atreides. The Messiah is a future's miracle, but for now it's time to experience the sacred novel written years ago by Frank Herbert, transforming into a flick that defines the contemporary era of cinema. Cinema is one of the magnificent creations that we have; it is an emotion, and it is beyond the flair of words. I'm just taking a moment of silence to calm after experiencing this miracle on the big screen. I felt the integration of visuals and sound. This film looks to be a perfect marriage between cinema and its rudiments. The imagination, creativity, and adroitness of filmmaking thrive in this world of Dune. Every second and every little element that made this megalithic Dune world breathtakingly gorgeous, extraordinarily soul-stirring, and purely a masterpiece that defined a new generation of cinema has been born. The best word to define cinema and the reason I love cinema is simply Dune....\nThis is Cinema !!Personally my greatest theatrical experience yet.Don't miss this rare masterpiece.

{"id": 1281, "title": "It's bad to hurt women.", "content": "After watching Villeneuve's first Dune (which didn't impress me at all), I felt an urge to re-read the novel and relive all the twists and turns of the book's plot in my memory. Interestingly, I found the part that is dedicated to the life and rise of Paul Atreides as a prophet and new messiah among the Fremen the most boring. Everything is dark, the plot develops slowly, and the Fremen's philosophy as well as their cultural and hygienic traits don't seem appealing at all. The intrigues of the cunning fox Vladimir Harkonnen, the genetic program of the Bene Gesserit, the telepathic abilities of Guild Navigators, and the flawless logic of the Mentats were much more fascinating.However, Villeneuve decided that it was the Fremen part that deserved more disclosure in the movie while all those Guild Navigators and Mentats were totally insignificant, which is why the entire world of Dune became flat and monotonous, and the characters lost all their depth. Wise Stilgar who was unusually thoughtful for a Freman and therefore led all the tribes of the planet, turned into a fanatical follower of the myth of the One and was a spitting image of Morpheus from The Matrix. The Emperor became a cowardly old man. Chani is a hysterical and possessive girlfriend. Lady Jessica is a simple plotter. But Vlad Harkonnen suffered the most. All his intelligence, cunning, ability to calculate the development of events several dozen steps ahead, wit and even love for boys disappeared. All that remained is his desire to eat and kill. He doesn't fit the role of the main villain so much that even dull Rabban seems like a brilliant strategist compared to him.And although Villeneuve's visuals are certainly very beautiful, he was unable to create something new and continued to copy the ideas of Lynch and the Wachowskis. Even the costumes were something out of BDSM, the theme that was once commenced in The Matrix, continued in The Chronicles of Riddick, and ended here in Dune. But if the costumes in the first two movies had a clear idea and contrasted with the costumes in other parts of the films, the obvious BDSM motifs in the clothes of the Imperial house in Dune provoke nothing but surprise. Why the beautiful princess Irulan, at the most crucial moment of her life, is dressed like Gimp (that guy in a leather suit from Pulp Fiction)? I can't explain it any other way than maybe the fact that Villeneuve has some difficulties with women, that's why all his female characters are weak-willed drama queens.How the simple-looking Florence Pugh got the role of the princess who was the product of thousands of years of Bene Gesserit genetic program, a tall aristocrat with classical beauty and a sharp mind, remains a mystery to me, as well as the tattooed letters on Lady Jessica's face that appeared there without any explanation, as if they were a natural symptom of pregnancy, like morning sickness.In general, the second film is more lively than the first one, but it's still boring, insipid and somehow aimless, because the moral of the story remains unknown.Judging by the last scene, it's \"bad to hurt women.\"", "rating": 6, "sentiment": 1, "date": "12 March 2024", "name": "Anna_Brassky"}

Just because he is the main guy, I guess.3) Timothy although is a famous actor, didn't have the stage presence to pull off sand Jesus. It doesn't feel like a commander, people just listen to him and it doesn't feel normal.4) The story progresses SOOO slowly, there are so many parts of this movie that don't make the story progress in any way.5) The story is also so incredibly annoying - the guy says that he will never go to the south, 10 minutes later he is going to the south. Strong convictions dude. He says he doesn't want anyone to die, two seconds later he is totally cool with it. Yes, he drank the water, so what? You don't have strong values, sand Jesus?6) The only \"jokes\" if you can call them that are from the goofy breaking tension character. But those are not jokes, they are just exaggerations and are not funny.7) The bad guys are so stereotypically bad, I don't feel their motivations. Also ZERO planning ahead. Instead of killing 1000s of their soldiers, they could just recruit a special unit to learn about the sand planet and then teach the rest of the soldiers. I just don't get it.8) The mother's transformation is also so freaking weird. I get it that that water is supposed to do some magic stuff to you but it completely kills the growth of the character and changes in ways that are not justifiable. It's very lazy writing.9) The prophecies and stuff make no sense, if that's a planet where people believe in them and magic stuff happens, why would people not believe? Like, you can see magic and stuff, why don't you believe? Just to be a rebel?10) Acting is also a bit not believable at times. I don't feel internal struggles.

Visually 10/10 I think this should be the hollywood standard for every big blockbuster movie. I belevie everything I saw was \"for real\" escpecially the Scene where Paul rides the sand worm. That scene was beuatifully done.Now for the rest of the movie, The Dialog at times where really akward escpecially in some fight scenes where characters just stopped the fight to stare and say 1 single word or sometimes nothing at all, just akward silence. At first I didnt really notice it but when this pattern repeated it self, It got to me.Also I thought the Movie was overconfusing sometimes where the main character paul would be called like 5 different names in some prophercy. So it was hard to keep track at times who they were talking about.So to sum it all up, I wasnt too keen on the first dune film but thought it was a pleasnt surprice though it lacked a bit of action.

{"id": 1294, "title": "Wow.", "content": "Simply put, Dune: Part Two is a modern masterpiece of cinema. This is an undoubtedly phenomenal piece of art, and Villeneuve's magnum opus. This movie asserts what a big, modern Blockbuster should be; beautiful visuals and sound design, accompanied by a sound story and compelling characters. People generally talk about the impressive scale of this movie and it's clear to see why. The world building rivals LOTR and tells a story so compelling as to stand in tandem with the likes of Star Wars. Dune: Part Two is fantasy at its best, its ability to keep you hooked while throwing so much information and unfamiliar language at you is unparalleled. However, like all movies, it's not without its flaws. I wouldn't call this a perfect film and people will of course have minor gripes with aspects of the story, but that is to be expected. Regardless, I think it comes pretty damn close to being a contender for the best movie of all time.. I know this seems to be a wacky claim, and I may well be riding the high of seeing the film just recently, but I truly think the sheer scale of Dune: Part Two rivals the all time greats of cinema. Dune has a little bit for everyone, and I feel anyone can get entertainment out of watching it, which can't be said for many modern movies. It avoids the pitfall of falling into one, succinct category. It is not JUST sci-fi fantasy, but a gripping drama, an enthralling adventure and a revenge story all in one. To summarise, it's good, real good and one of those rare movies that you HAVE to see. I think it's \"must see\" status is only comprable to last year's Oppenheimer.", "rating": 10, "sentiment": 1, "date": "9 March 2024", "name": "hbarber-80894"}
{"id": 1295, "title": "Mirages and Missed Chances: Navigating the Illusions of \"Dune: Part Two\"", "content": "In the sweeping sands of the cinematic landscape, \"Dune: Part Two\" stands as a monument-grand in its ambition, yet at times, as elusive in substance as the mirage of an oasis in the vast desert of Arrakis. It's a tale spun with the threads of ambition, power, and the intoxicating allure of spice, but also one that, in its execution, frequently stumbles beneath the weight of its narrative dunes.At the heart of \"Dune: Part Two\" lies an underexplored marvel-the potentially profound capabilities of the sandworms, the behemoths of Arrakis. These titanic beings are intriguingly positioned within the narrative. Given that they excrete pre-spice, are immersed in spice, and have concentrated spice in their urine (water of life) that grants visions of the future to sentient beings and the power to traverse the cosmos, one might anticipate these creatures to possess a heightened consciousness, perhaps even a symbiotic relationship with those who dare to ingest their spice-saturated excretions. But nothing.Furthermore, Paul Atredies' unique bond with the essence of Arrakis hints at a doorway to deeper communication or kinship with the creatures at the center of it all. Yet, this path remains untraveled even though the later books address it by the continuing Atreides line (human worm hybrid anyone?) provide\nPermission to do so. The film skirts around the edge of such a revelatory interaction between humans and worms, leaving us to ponder the missed opportunities. Could these guardians of spice not play a more pivotal role, extending beyond their physical enormity to touch upon a more mystical, interconnected existence? This could connect to the more significant Herbert world-building and even make excuses for some of the unexplained asymmetrical warfare successes achieved by the Fremen. That could be too big a stretch for reimagining Herbert's work. Such potential for a profound connection, maybe even guidance or guardianship from the worms to their riders or those touched by the spice, languishes like hidden treasure beneath the sands, untouched and untold. What a waste.As the story unfolds, its pacing-reminiscent of a trek across endless dunes-tests the patience, weaving through moments of sheer visual spectacle and auditory grandeur, thanks in no small part to Hans Zimmer's haunting score. Yet, for all its visual and auditory splendor, the journey feels laborious, a testament to the challenge of adapting Herbert's universe. While aiming for epic proportions, the battles and the dance of political machinations often fall short of their mark, leaving an aftertaste of missed opportunities. The Emperor falls more quickly than the House of Atredies in Part One. And as much as I like Walken, I found him utterly unconvincing as the ruler of the known universe. I half expected him to challenge Chalemet to a dance-off in the film's final hand-to-hand combat scene. That role was fulfilled by Elvis Presley, of course.Austin Butler and Javier Bardem shine among the constellation of performances; Butler breaks free from the shadow of Elvis, and Bardem channels his intensity, and both deliver moments of genuine brilliance. Yet, not all stars in this universe burn as brightly, with many portrayals failing to ignite the emotional connection vital to the epic's core. Chalamet's whipsawing between \"Am I using this culture for my benefit or do I have a messiah complex?\" was unconvincing and tiresome. Zendaya just seemed constantly pissed off. The couple's relationship development after months in the sand and what all to all intents was an explosive love story didn't tee up Atredies decisions in the climax. Utterly unconvincing.This discrepancy in performance quality, combined with rushed and sluggish pacing, leaves the narrative adrift, caught between the sands of ambition and the glassy clarity of coherence.The film's aspiration is its spice and groggy blue-eyed hangover-an attempt to capture the vastness of Herbert's vision, yet constantly losing sight of the personal, human elements that anchor us to the story. I have to care about these characters and couldn't care less for so many of them. Part script. Part acting. Unfortunately, the editing, a dance of shadows itself, struggles to balance its scope's grandeur with its characters' microcosm, leaving audiences wandering in search of the emotional oases that are few and far between.Admittedly, I approached the Dune movies without the foundation of their literary counterpart. Despite considering the book, I decided to avoid diving into its pages. My hesitation stemmed from a perceived slowness and, no pun intended, dryness. It also appeared to boast a style that put me off: self-importance, a trait humorously reminiscent of the self-righteous Prius drivers in a particular \"South Park\" episode, seemingly intoxicated by their virtue. My literary journeys have traversed the realms crafted by, amongst others, Asimov, Clarke, Gibson, and Banks, where the pace quickens and the imagination soars. I care so much for the characters that I'm there with them. Sufficed to say, or should I say sure-spiced, the films are only serving to reinforce my feelings about the Dune universe. Cool ideas alone are not enough. It reminds me of the quote;\"A special effect without a story is a pretty boring thing.\"\nGeorge LucasI need clarification on the film's narrative decisions, especially the emphasis on antiquated nuclear weaponry as apex warfare tools. In a universe adorned with advanced spaceships and protective shields, a space guild who fold space-time and orbital weapons from Part One that shreds the Atredies armada. As such, prioritizing these \"dusty nukes\" strikes a curious note. It conjures questions about technological progression-or perhaps regression-echoing a bizarre space-age crusade armed with swords and standards rather than innovating beyond the familiar arsenal to at least the level of Part One. Even deploying the impressive mountain-destroying \"good old fashioned artillery\" Baron Hakkonen so excitedly celebrates only half an hour previously would have changed the outcome of the final battle.In this reflection of Arrakis, \"Dune: Part Two\" is a journey of contrasts, where valleys of unfulfilled potential shadow each peak of visual and cinematic achievement. It invites us into a universe where the boundless possibilities of human ambition and the dangers of power are laid bare, yet leaves us yearning for the stories untold, for the deeper dive into the essence of spice and the beings intertwined with its fate.As the sands settle, \"Dune: Part Two\" emerges as an attempted take on a complex, layered tale that, like the spice, reveals both the brilliance and the challenges of adapting a universe as rich and intricate as Herbert's. It was also a missed opportunity to bring that story into the 21st century and, through reimagination, distill and refine Herbert's work to make it more potent like the water of life. It's a reminder that in the quest to traverse such vast narrative landscapes, the journey itself is as crucial as the destination.And while \"Dune: Part Two\" had moments of breathtaking beauty, missed connections, unconvincing characters, and unrealized depths swallowed it beneath the sand.", "rating": 6, "sentiment": 1, "date": "8 March 2024", "name": "woodgiesubs"}

Unfortunately, my expectations were not met, as the sequel proved to be just as convoluted and inaccessible as its predecessor.One of the biggest issues with Dune Part Two is its overwhelming reliance on complex lore and exposition. While I understand that the Dune universe is rich with detail, the film bombards viewers with so much information that it becomes difficult to follow the plot or connect with the characters on any meaningful level.The pacing of the film is also a major stumbling block. Scenes drag on for what feels like an eternity, only to be followed by abrupt shifts in tone and narrative focus. This lack of cohesion makes it challenging to stay engaged with the story, leading to frequent moments of boredom and frustration.Furthermore, the performances from the cast, while commendable in their effort, fail to elevate the material. It's clear that the actors are doing their best with the material they've been given, but ultimately, their talents are wasted on characters who lack depth or development.Visually, Dune Part Two is a mixed bag. While some of the special effects are impressive, others feel cheap and unconvincing. The overall aesthetic of the film is bleak and unappealing, making it difficult to find anything visually stimulating or memorable.In conclusion, Dune Part Two is a disappointing sequel that fails to improve upon the shortcomings of its predecessor.

{"id": 1299, "title": "Fantastic", "content": "Dune Part 2 is truly amazing in terms of story, music, visuals and characters. The film is almost 3 hours long but it doesn't feel like it because the storyline is not boring and each character is also not wasted. A masterpiece in the midst of superhero films that are starting to get bored and have no clear direction. As a sequel dune 2 starts the story without missing a beat. Paul Atreides (Timothee Chalamet) and his mother, Lady Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson), continue their adventure on the desert planet Arrakis.Out of the clutches of the Harkonnen, they try to join the Fremen, including Chani (Zendaya), who appeared several times in Paul's dreams in the first film. As Paul tries to understand their customs, Lady Jessica tells the Fremen that her son is the leader they have been waiting for according to the prophecy.Denis Villeneuve succeeded in presenting perfect details. The worlds he creates are stunning, from the desert of Arrakis to majestic palaces. The appearance of giant sandworms and neatly choreographed battle scenes are entertainment for those who enjoy the sci-fi action genre. Villeneuve succeeded in transforming the visuals from Frank Herbert's novel beautifully in every scene.Dune 2 also presents deep and interesting characters. Timothee Chalamet takes Paul Atreides to new heights with a compelling performance, just the right amount of charismatic and intimidating, conveying the complexity of Paul's character ideally. Zendaya, who previously only appeared a few times in Dune: Part One, now has the opportunity to explore Chani's character as a strong and brave figure.The presence of supporting roles such as Lady Jessica and Princess Irula (Florence Pugh) also adds to the complexity of the political complexities in the world created by Villeneuve. Javier Bardem as Stilgar also gave an extraordinary performance that will stick in the audience's memory.

{"id": 1302, "title": "Dune 2 review", "content": "The film Dune 2 practically begins where the first one ended. Therefore, before watching the second part, it's worth refreshing our memory with Dune 1.The creators of the film tried to stay as faithful to the original material as possible, but due to the limitations of the cinematic format, they had to omit some important parts of the book and even certain characters. We will only see Jessica and Leto Atreides daughter as an embryo in her mother's womb. Consequently, we won't witness the crucial conversation between Alia, the Baron, and the Emperor. Additionally, the Mentat Hawat is absent in the second part, and Piter De Vries makes only a brief appearance. The time span from Duke Leto Atreides' death to the final scene in the book has also been shortened. While in the novel, it spans 4-5 years, in the film, it's less than 9 months. It's unlikely that such a short period could transform a 17-year-old boy into a leader of rebels.The screenplay's shortcomings are fully compensated by the cinematography and artistic techniques. Each frame is a professional work of art. The wide shots of House Harkonnen's military might, the architecture of Arrakis, the eight-legged military vehicles, desert landscapes, and the Fremen riding on sandworms-all unfold on the screen accompanied by Hans Zimmer's hypnotic music.Expressive techniques were also generously employed to enhance the visual context: Feyd-Rautha's battle with the captive warriors of House Atreides, the cannibals, the intimate scene in Lady De Vries' chamber, and more. It's precisely these non-verbal visual techniques that make viewers appreciate Villeneuve's films.\"\nThe characters in Denis Villeneuve's film Dune have been meticulously crafted with attention to detail and aesthetics, even when it comes to the most unpleasant portrayals. Viewers don't need to search for hidden meanings behind the characters because the visual component makes them highly comprehensible.Regarding the acting, we haven't seen anything fundamentally new compared to Dune 1. However, there are some notable aspects worth mentioning.Director Villeneuve gave Paul Atreides less than 9 months for his transformation into Muad'Dib. Did Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet manage this 'quantum leap'? In the final part of the film, Chalamet carries the emotional weight of almost all scenes, while other characters, including Jessica and Stilgar, take a backseat, serving as the backdrop for Muad'Dib. Whether the actor justified the director's trust is not a straightforward answer. Paul Atreides's internal ambivalence as a character is complex-on one hand, there's contradiction, vision, reflection, and doubt; on the other hand, there's determination, responsibility, and firmness. Perhaps due to the limited time, convincing execution of challenging scenes fell short. The director's mistake is that Muad'Dib may be the messiah, but not the executioner. Whether the actor had real chances for success with such a complex task remains an open question.In Dune 1, Baron Vladimir Harkonnen was the primary antagonist, but in Dune 2, we witness the rivalry between uncle and nephew, which turns into a true acting battle. Stellan Skarsg\u00e5rd, although performing his role well, ultimately takes a backseat.\"\nLow-set eyes on a pale, cold face, and the black palate of a half-open mouth with plump, almost childlike lips magnetically draw attention. Austin Butler kept the focus of the audience on his character with a kind of cheeky ease while Timothee Chalamet went crazy with who he now has to show people: Paul Atreides, Muad'Dib, Usul, Kwisatz Haderach, Lisan al-Gaib. Butler doesn't have a lot of experience as a leading actor in box office films. The main role of Elvis Presley is rather an exception. However, Feyd-Rautha provides the best acting contribution in the second part of Dune. It's one of those cases where you want to witness character development, but the script doesn't afford that opportunity.The film also sheds light on important contemporary themes through the events unfolding on Arrakis. It's not entirely clear whether Denis Villeneuve intended to draw parallels with the present day or if it's merely his interpretation of the original book's text.Dune 2 vividly portrays the struggle against a cruel aggressor who plays the role of a colonizer and a sadistic killer. The 'good old simple solutions' involving artillery against the peaceful population of Siach Tabr to suppress resistance serve as a poignant example. The film also emphasizes the significance of possessing nuclear weapons, while climate change concerns take a backseat.Among the Fremen, there's no unified survival strategy, and the choice between fighting and fleeing sparks heated debates. Resisting the aggressor could lead to a prolonged and bloody galactic war. Ownership of a valuable resource keeps the Fremen at the center of political battles.\"\nThe fair-skinned aristocrat Paul Atreides attempts to find common ground with the Fremen. Despite his bold actions, he doesn't escape mockery from the native inhabitants of Arrakis. Paul becomes a messiah for the Fremen due to their fanatical belief in religious prophecies, but was it truly his desire, and are the Fremen ready to follow their Lisan al-Gaib beyond the boundaries of Arrakis?The final scene of the power struggle in Dune 2 reveals that the Messiah on the throne transforms into a politician. Did his followers understand this? Perhaps the answers lie in the third installment of the saga.In Denis Villeneuve's film, Princess Irulan possesses ambitions and motivations, unlike her portrayal in the original book. This adds intrigue to the anticipation of Dune 3. Additionally, viewers catch a glimpse of Paul's sister, Alia.In Frank Herbert's novel, Chani is presented within the framework of a patriarchal world, but Villeneuve pushes her beyond those limits. Chani in the film is independent and self-assured, refusing to be 'first among equals.' The film's conclusion appears more vivid than in the book, thanks to sharp contradictions and conflicts among the characters, which piques interest for the future sequel.Overall, Dune 2 has set the stage for an epic cinematic saga that science fiction enthusiasts have long awaited.", "rating": 10, "sentiment": 1, "date": "12 March 2024", "name": "buhfxy"}

{"id": 1305, "title": "Desert Odyssey: Navigating the Sands of Power and Prophecy in 'Dune 2'", "content": "\"Dune 2\" triumphantly returns us to the desolate yet mesmerizing landscapes of Arrakis, continuing the epic saga with a narrative depth and visual splendor that surpasses its predecessor. Director Denis Villeneuve masterfully escalates the stakes, weaving a tale of power, betrayal, and destiny that is as intellectually stimulating as it is emotionally gripping.The film's pacing is deliberate, each scene meticulously crafted to deepen the story's complexities and the characters' journeys. Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet reprises his role as Paul Atreides with a performance that is both vulnerable and commanding, embodying the weight of prophecy and leadership with nuanced grace. The ensemble cast, including Zendaya, Rebecca Ferguson, and newcomers that bring fresh intrigue and dynamics, delivers performances that are profoundly compelling, enriching the narrative's multifaceted themes.Visually, \"Dune 2\" is nothing short of spectacular. Villeneuve, alongside cinematographer Greig Fraser, captures the alien beauty of Arrakis with awe-inspiring shots that are both vast in scale and intimate in detail. The special effects are seamlessly integrated, enhancing the storytelling without overshadowing it, and the score by Hans Zimmer is as haunting as it is exhilarating, further immersing the audience in the film's atmospheric world.Narratively, the sequel expands the Dune universe with a deft hand, exploring the political machinations, cultural depth, and ecological mysteries of Arrakis with a sophistication that is rare in science fiction cinema. The film's exploration of themes such as leadership, sacrifice, and ecological stewardship are timely and thought-provoking, inviting viewers to reflect on parallels within our own world.If there's an area where \"Dune 2\" could improve, it might be in offering even more screen time to its supporting characters, whose backstories and motivations beg for deeper exploration. Nonetheless, this is a minor critique in an otherwise exceptional film.In conclusion, \"Dune 2\" is a cinematic masterpiece that not only honors Frank Herbert's legacy but also pushes the boundaries of what science fiction can achieve on the big screen. It is a visually stunning, emotionally resonant, and intellectually rewarding experience that sets a new benchmark for the genre. As the credits roll, one can't help but eagerly anticipate the next chapter in this breathtaking saga.", "rating": 9, "sentiment": 1, "date": "1 March 2024", "name": "gerard-thompson"}

A complex universe has been rendered on film as spectacularly boring and bereft of dramatic moments despite the source material's majesty... it defies belief how you can take something so powerful and create such a dud...I would challenge anyone to watch that movie and tell me they gave a damn about anything or anyone contained within it.A perfect exemplar of our times: pretty, vacuous and without depth or integrity...Walken is so miscast that every time he talks the universe breaks at the seamsTimothee Chalamet lacks presence and in his defense is not helped by Paul not being written very well.Zendaya is the best performer of the cast but Chani (as written for the film) is a worryingly emotional liability of a Fremen warrior - perhaps written this way to give Paul Atriedes the appearance of strength. She does incredibly well with a dumb scriptThe Worms (as creatures) have such integral value to the story and their relationship to Spice is completely absent. They are literally like organic trains for the Fremen.

Do you ever feel that the contemporary directors care more in sending the (political) message through their movies than entertain? Do you look back at the movies of 15-25 years ago and get troubled at how did this old successful recipe vanished?Dune part II comes to thankfully show us that movies of that old majesty is not yet dead.Dune is a science fiction movie with an epic tale, well written story, stunning special effects, talented and likable actors filled with heroism and chivalry (even the bad guys showed some kind of value over the opponent) of the old days. This movie has no much drama and none of the contemporary social conflicts 99% of the today movies include, nor any gender rivalry or non realistic (non) feminine behaviour in women. Dune part II is a masterpiece that focus on the story on the character development and the complexity of powers acting over the main protagonists bringing conflicts and shifting on their initial pure intentions. Dune part II surpasses the previous Dune and reaches at a peak level of greatness in the seventh art! It fills holes and answers questions that might have baffled the viewers in the first movie (me personally). For those who haven't read the books or even haven't watched any previous adaptation is a very well understandable film that needs no other filler info.Well done Denis Villeneuve, you have delivered us a masterpiece the next generations will talk about and have it as a beacon for future movies to come!I suggest this movie to anyone who loves science fiction movies, adventure and quest movies, fantasy and other planets movies, or even to those who like love stories and surely to those who enjoy a story with a complex political background and scheming.", "rating": 10, "sentiment": 1, "date": "9 March 2024", "name": "sword_stelios"}

Anyone who doesn't know it (or didn't watch it carefully, like me the first time) will generally find it difficult or difficult to find their way around the confusing \"Duniverse\".But after watching \"Dune\" again with concentration the day before, I largely understood the content and was ready for Part 2:\nIn my opinion, this is a more than worthy successor and even a slightly better film than part 1. The images and the visual atmosphere are pure force. You are literally sucked into the science fiction world of the desert planet like the Sardaukar into the mouth of the worm and sink into the extensive sand dunes of this story. Not only the visual, but especially the sound design is captivating. Especially when the giant sandworms/\"Shai-Hulud\" take over the screen and make the cinema tremble just like the endless grains of sand from Arrakis.The star-studded cast once again stands out - especially Hollywood's newcomer elite with Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet, Zendaya and Austin Butler - and other familiar faces constantly appear. The costumes, sets and computer effects are also of a high standard across the board.The massive 166 minutes of running time don't drag at all and feel like they go by quicker.A lot happens in the plot and the (desert) images, sounds, entertaining action sequences and Paul Atreides' character development captivated me.Personally, I still don't fully understand the content. A week ago, however, I would have had serious doubts about whether I personally ultimately liked the two films. Especially since I'm not a real sci-fi fan (except for \"Star Wars\", although you can debate whether it's sci-fi in that sense), such social hype tends to annoy me and I know the first part - now I know that it was due to my lack of attention - I remembered it as boring and stupid. I think the two parts are very good as a work of art in themselves and as a film.Frank Herbert came up with a crazy world and story that didn't really appeal to me in terms of lore/content, but was filmed by Denis Villeneuve and was absolutely worth seeing. They may not be my favorite films or ones that I really enjoyed, but it is definitely an experience to watch them and to immerse yourself in this world like Paul supposedly once did in the lakes and seas of Caladan.Finally, I would describe \"Dune (Part Two)\" with the following words: cinematic experience, epochal, entertaining, captivating, bombastic, confusing, attractive, unique.A film that demands attention, but also absolutely deserves it.

However, it's difficult to say one is better than the other because they are two very different films. That is natural, of course, for any epic franchise as the story progresses. With that being said, the first and second half of part 2 also feel like two different films. I felt like it started out slow and then was rushed at times.The first half takes us through Paul and Lady Jessica's acclimation into the Fremen. Paul transitions seamlessly, confirming the beliefs held by some that he is in fact the messiah. I understand the necessity of this especially as far as building up the following for the Lisan Al Giab. But it felt like some of this could have been cut down and more energy put into the second half. I did enjoy meeting the emperor and princess Irulan and learning more about the influence of the Bene Gesserit.The second half of the film has a different tone. Lord Baron may be the antagonist but one of my favorite aspects of this film is getting to delve deeper into House Harkonnen. We are introduced to Feyd-Rautha, who may be one of the greatest villains in cinematic history. I felt like this arc should have been explored more than some of the others. Paul's transformation to what may be Kwisatz Haderach is bewitching and is worthy of a 10 star review on its own. I would have liked to see more of the Bene Gesserit and Lady Jessica being a badass, which is one of the reasons I loved part 1 so much. Even though the film is nearly three hours long, I'd like to see an extended version of the second half.", "rating": 9, "sentiment": 1, "date": "4 March 2024", "name": "broken_princess08"}

A lot of useless scenes in my opinion, and Zendaya looking angry at the camera for 1 and a half hour. In other words, the excessive runtime left me questioning the necessity of a three-hour saga. Numerous scenes felt gratuitous and added little to the overall plot, contributing to a sense of dragging monotony. Zendaya's prolonged stern expressions, seemingly directed at the camera, became a repetitive distraction rather than a compelling element.

{"id": 1330, "title": "It should have been two movies", "content": "I am sorry to admit it, but I was a bit disappointed by Dune Part 2. Don't get me wrong, I truly think that it is a far better movie than anything of the genre that was released since Dune Part one, but this movie has flaws that prevented me from fully enjoying it. I am a huge fan of off Denis Villeneuve. We have the same age and we even come from the same town in Qu\u00e9bec, Canada. I watched everything that he as done many times and I think that his work is up there with the movies from the best of the industry. Dune 2 is beautiful in every way, most of the actors are great, and the dialogues are very good. However, some stuff did not do it for me. First, the love story between Paul and Shani happens to quickly and we seem to miss many parts of it as there are cuts in the storyline jumping from a moment to a later one. They are lovers and palls but not on the same page which could have been better exploited. The second thing is Jessica going from a loving mother and decent reasonable person to a freaking witch in a, instant. Again, things went to far too quickly. Thirdly, the battle scene was too short, way too short. The Sardaukars are supposed to be the best, but they did not even fight really. We saw very little of the battles. It could have been 5 to 7 minutes longer with a lot more happening. Major disappointment for me. Another thing that did not work for me was that there was almost nothing of the backstory of Gurny behing a smuggler. How can smugglers even exists knowing how controlling the Arkenens are? I did not get that at all. Gurney's character even went a bit wild. I thought that he was a strong but thoughtful and smart man. The emperor seemed like an old and weak man, one that could have been easily controlled by the Bene Gesserit. That did work for me either. And how about the end of the Baron that could not fight, could no do anything to defend itself. A missed opportunities of having a solid argument between Paul and him. Knowing that Alia is the one that killed the Baron in the booking, she could at least have been involved in a way or another through her mother. I truly believe that Part two should have been two separate movies. There was too much story to tell for one single movie. To much thing happening and to much character evolving too rapidly. In a first movie, the fight between the Arkonens and the Fremen could have had a larger escalation. A second movie would be all about the rise of Paul and a longer and more detailed battle. The north and south thing for me was useless and could have been skipped by Denis. By making two movies, we could have more action sequences and a far better understanding of the motivations for each character. Paul's transformation from a smart and sensible young man to a messiah figure could have made more sense if it happened slower, with more self-resistance. Paul became a tyrant in an instant. My final negative reaction is for the studio. The trailer revealed to much and it showed most of the best visual of the entire movie. Dune part two is a blessing and the fact that this Saga was greenlighted knowing how impossible in this to make a movie of these books that are both cleaver and weird at the same time is almost unbelievable knowing how bad the industry is right now. I am glad that the movie did well in the box office for its opening weekend. Go see it for yourself.", "rating": 8, "sentiment": 1, "date": "4 March 2024", "name": "gaetanbouchard"}

{"id": 1332, "title": "Amazing Movie", "content": "\"Dune: Part Two\" emerges as a cinematic tour de force, encapsulating the essence of Frank Herbert's classic with an execution that can only be described as visually and auditorially mesmerizing. Director Denis Villeneuve's vision transcends the confines of traditional science fiction, elevating this film into a realm of unparalleled immersion, where the desolate beauty of Arrakis and the intricate complexities of Herbert's universe are brought to life with staggering clarity and emotional depth.The visuals in \"Dune: Part Two\" are nothing short of breathtaking. Villeneuve, along with cinematographer Greig Fraser, crafts a visual palette that is as vast and sweeping as the dunes themselves. Each frame is a meticulously designed masterpiece, capturing the stark beauty of the desert landscape, the opulence of the imperial court, and the visceral intensity of the Fremen's struggle. The use of practical effects, augmented by judicious CGI, creates a tactile realism that grounds the story's fantastical elements in a palpable reality. The sweeping shots of Arrakis's desert, the intricate designs of the spaceships and technology, and the hauntingly beautiful Sietches of the Fremen are rendered with such detail and care that they become characters in their own right.Hans Zimmer's score complements the visuals to create an immersive experience that is truly extraordinary. His music for \"Dune: Part Two\" is both haunting and evocative, weaving traditional Middle Eastern motifs with futuristic synths to underscore the film's themes of destiny, power, and transformation. The score ebbs and flows with the narrative, amplifying the emotional resonance of key moments, from the thunderous clashes of battle to the intimate whispers of prophecy. Zimmer's ability to capture the soul of Herbert's universe in his compositions adds a layer of depth to the film that transcends the visual spectacle, ensnaring the audience in a sensory embrace that is both exhilarating and deeply moving.For fans of the original novels, \"Dune: Part Two\" offers a nuanced interpretation of Paul Atreides' journey that both honors and challenges Herbert's intentions. In the books, particularly in \"Dune Messiah,\" Herbert sought to subvert the traditional hero's journey by presenting Paul as a deeply flawed figure, whose rise to power brings about not salvation but suffering. This film bravely embraces that complexity, depicting Paul not as the unblemished hero many have come to expect but as a young man grappling with the weight of prophecy, the seductions of power, and the moral ambiguities of his actions.This portrayal of Paul is a bold narrative choice, reflecting a deeper understanding of Herbert's critique of the hero myth. By emphasizing Paul's darker impulses and the consequences of his decisions, \"Dune: Part Two\" challenges viewers to reconsider their perceptions of leadership, heroism, and destiny. It's a testament to Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet's performance that Paul remains a compelling, if increasingly troubled, protagonist. Chalamet captures the internal conflict of a character caught between destiny and desire, bringing a nuanced depth to Paul that is both captivating and unsettling.The decision to delve into the darker aspects of Paul's character aligns with Herbert's own reflections on the misinterpretation of \"Dune.\" Herbert was concerned that readers glorified Paul as a hero, missing the cautionary tale of power and its pitfalls. This film rectifies that, presenting a vision of Paul that is more in line with Herbert's intentions, and in doing so, enriches the narrative with complexity and ambiguity.\"Dune: Part Two\" is a masterful continuation of Villeneuve's adaptation, a film that not only captures the grandeur and majesty of Herbert's universe but also engages with its most challenging themes. The combination of stunning visuals, a captivating score, and a willingness to explore the moral complexities of its protagonist makes this film a remarkable achievement. It's a cinematic experience that not only entertains but also invites reflection on the nature of power, heroism, and the human condition, solidifying its place as a landmark in science fiction filmmaking.", "rating": 10, "sentiment": 1, "date": "3 March 2024", "name": "woodethx"}

{"id": 1335, "title": "Spicediver", "content": "I enjoyed this movie. I thought it was very entertaining. Many of the things done in this movie continue the developing story of Paul very well. As the director said at one point, he wanted to show a different side of Paul, that is often lost on the audience, especially whenever Frank released the first book for the first time.Paul is supposed to be a bad guy sorta, he is supposed to be taking revenge on his uncle for his father's death. He wants power, he wants control, and he wants to use that power and control to lead humanity down a certain path. As you get through the story towards the final books released by Franks son, in my opinion, the story comes full circle. Eventually Chani and Paul are just normal people living on Dune as clones of their former selves. Free from all the fighting. As is all of humanity. But that is neither here nor there. This story being told today is never going to be able to tell the whole story of how they got there, 5000+ years into the future. Because of that, it makes no sense to me that they chose to make this movie and tell this story this way.I have no idea where he wants to take this movie series. I imagine Chani will eventually turn on Paul and it would surprise me if she doesn't considering how aggressive he made her towards Paul. So many things are so different from the book/books. Which is fine, because he is telling his own story. However I didn't come here to watch his telling of this story, I came here to watch Dune. I want the story of Dune.My biggest complaint here is that they did not tell the story of Dune, the spice, and why it is so important. I know it is hard to do that, which is why they are choosing to tell the story the way they are. But their is a version of Dune that tells that story. I recommend that people find a way to watch it.Watch Spicediver's Fan Edit of the original dune. In July of 2022, but originally many years ago, a fan that goes by Spicediver, released a Alternate edition. It goes by Dune 1984 The alternative edition redux, a special 1080p edition. This is about 178 mins long and cuts the movie into bits that are more digestible. Explains the story much more completely. It really is the best way to experience Dune, you will not come out confused and despite it not completely following the book. It surely does tell a more complete story that you will walk away from enjoying. It has a slower pace, but also has a more complete story.I liked this movie, I liked the first one. But I have to recommend the alternate edition. It does a much better job than anybody else at editing and putting together a coherent story that really draws you into a sci-fi world ruled by power hungry madmen hopped up on a future drug that enhances the power of humans to near god like levels.", "rating": 7, "sentiment": 1, "date": "4 March 2024", "name": "rileypatrick30"}
{"id": 1336, "title": "Missing storylines, why?", "content": "It's a very good movie to start with, but I have some 4 issues, or if I may add, 4 storylines that could have been better addressed and have been better elaborated. To start with, when Paul had to go out in the desert to be tested, Bardem spooks him with the desert's perils and Djins that he need to be very alarmed with. Now, we are eager to see what will happen to him in the desert! Nope, we don't see all these fearful events, why? There was a big entertainment and a test of Paul's mettle to be witnessed, but for some reason, the film disregards this storyline! Shame. It would have been fun to watch.The second issue, we don't see Paul raging against the Harkonnen troops except one scene. It doesn't sell the idea that he has become respected by the Fremen. How can a stranger win the hearts of warriors ? Unless we see him in a couple of battles or raids to show his courage, strength, and fighting abilities so we believe in him as well.The third big issue, is when he takes the water of life. Hello! This is a major event and to this endeavor, we hoped to see a preparation for the scene, a yet a huge ceremony like event were everyone is witnessing this transformation. It is either a miserable-painful death, or a glorification of the new Kwisatz Haderach. This is a huge becoming of a leader, I would have loved to see a mesmerizing enchanting scene. Then, how did the water of life affected him. What did he feel like? How does he relate to the spice and the universe, as it was slightly revealed or pictured in the original 1984 version of Dune. Another big moment that we missed.Another side issue, in the original version, we see Paul standing high addressing the Fremen in the millions; we don't see this in this version. Now, regardless whether the book make sense that there are millions in the south and how come no one was aware of them, or at least, how come they move around without being noticed by all the advanced technologies? Millions not a few hundred like the people in north. Anyway, a scene with thousands of Fremen fighters gathered to cheer their new leader would have added a lot of visual depth to the plot.Continuing. This is my last issue. The scene where the emperor comes to Arrakis is so mitigated. This is a space opera scene par excellence and we missed to see the pompous entourage of the emperor. This could have been a grandiose scene with all the glory of an ending to the movie. The space looked so unfitting to an emperor and the story at large.Alas, if these storylines were developed and elaborated more, the movie would have been super amazing.One last thing, Rabban's nick name is the beast.

{"id": 1337, "title": "An incredible yet flawed piece of cinema", "content": "Heading into the cinema, I had extremely high hopes for the second installment of Dune, after the first film set the scene, and to the most part, I was not disappointed.There was some incredible pieces of videography and editing, with some of the shots of the desert and the battles breathtaking. Zendaya was superb and Chalamet's performance was the best I've seen from him (admittedly I've only seen him in a couple of other things). One issue I do have with the development of Paul/ Usal/ Muad'dib is that he went from desert 'newbie' being sent off to survive, and then 10 minutes later, he was riding a massive sand worm. I can only assume this would have been longer of there was the runtime for it, but with the film being almost 3 hours, it was cut down which is understandable.As an atheist, I couldn't help but chuckle when Stilgar (Javier Bardem) claimed and hailed Paul's messiah status anytime he did anything, but that's what this film is about. Faith, hope and fate in the face of adversity. Further, Bardem's performance was arguably the best of the stellar cast. He keeps the leadership qualities of Stilgar, while keeping his faith and that little bit of mystery, still, about him and his people.Another important part was the snippet into the life of the emperor (Christopher Walken) and his daughter (Florence Pugh) which gave the audience a better understanding of the politics of the houses and the empire. This also allowed the development of my favourite storyline in the franchise, that of the Bene Gesserit. As a group, there intentions are incredibly mixed and difficult to see. The leader seems to simply want to have influence over the emperor and doesn't care who that is. Lady Jessica simply wants her son to have all the power in the world, and the power they have is fascinating. The emperor's daughter is an interesting character as she starts off innocently enough, before being revealed as a witch (?) and then simply accepted Paul's hand in marriage and she's played brilliantly by Florence Pugh, despite the small role. Speaking of the ending, it's a bit odd which Paul going power crazy and ditching Chani for another girl's hand in marriage. It does make sense, to a degree, especially when you consider the fact there needs to be some lose ends to tie up for a third film.Based on what I've said so far, this would be a 9/10 film but the reason it's down to an 8 is the music. My friends agreed when we saw it (and the same with the first film) but it seems a bit overdone. The religious, lisan Al gaib type theme came up far too often, sometimes when Paul was just standing there. It also took away from the battle, with that being overlayed with a more classic battle tune, which I think took away from the suspense a bit. Further, the timing was a bit off. The music should come a second after a revelation, not before, which happened a couple of times. For example, at one point, the theme started while we could only see sand, a second before actually seeing something of significance.To conclude, a stunning film, and a great improvement on the first but the music and one or two plot points stop it from being an all time great.

From the brilliant visual effects to the incredible performances, this movie is one of the best sequels that I have ever seen.Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet really stood up in this film by portraying Paul in such a powerful and mesmerizing way that it leaves you wondering what kind of character Paul Atreides really is. I found myself rooting for him in the beginning of the movie, but by the end of it, I started questioning his choices and wondering if this was \"the only way\" or if he got power hungry in this whole process.Another powerful performance was from Austin Butler as Feyd-Rautha. He was scary, he was fearless, and he was visually the most interesting actor to look at.I can't write a proper review for Dune 2 without talking about Denis Villeneuve, the person who made it all possible.

The storyline meanders through these dialogues, with much of the plot progression feeling stagnant and devoid of the thrilling moments one might anticipate from such a richly conceived universe. Except for the climactic final battle, which admittedly was executed with a degree of excellence, the rest of the film felt surprisingly monotonous and lacked the excitement and engagement that the visually stunning universe and intricate lore of Dune promise.

What more, I'm happy they changed some details, like when Alia (Paul's sister), as a four-year-old child, kills baron Vladimir Harkonnen.You see Zendaya casually chatting and laughing on the dunes with her friend, which degrades the efforts made in part one to create a picture of how hostile the whole planet is. Also, Stilgar's \"funny\" appearance, especially the short scenes where he speaks about prophecy, completely erased his character's authority alongside the other Fremen who should be depicted as fiercely warriors.Visuals and sound are mostly very good, but it lacks some time to absorb a beautiful design concepts in comparison with the part one where you can enjoy those close combat shield effects and also Sardukar chanting. The whole Harkonnens world looks too plastic, without any filth and looks like cheap CGI.Even though Villeneuve claimed that he doesn't care about dialogs and he wants to create a movie based on a picture and sound, I could rate scenes based on the speech and actors' appearance. I can say that I expected more from Christopher Walken's and Stellan's scene, Feyd-Rautha's character's cocky behavior is somehow too mainstream and expected, but on the other hand, Florence Pugh's and Timothee's performances were very strong.The last but the most important thing that made the whole movie worse than part one is that it's too fast at pace.

Story maintains a perfect pace with a climatic ending I feel that the director definitely took some inspiration from got as some scenes seemed very familiar, not a bad thing but when you see the scenes you'll immediately think of got.Only negative if I can find one is Zendaya's acting. The way she portrayed her strong emotions scemes made me laugh. She looked like a sulking child thats been told off for eating too many sweets, ridiculous acting. Shows her limitations.

Where are the scenes with Paul Atreides' sister? Where is the confrontation with the Bene Gesserit? I wonder if the director read the books or just had a secondhand script written by someone who had no idea they were working on a screen adaptation of a book...even more. He could extract the essence and all that was uplifting in the story. I am extremely angry. Someone spent a lot of money on a movie that I couldn't wait to see because I knew it was an adaptation of some books that really impressed me but I was tricked into seeing a very nicely packaged mess... . .. The packaging was perfect but inside.......nothing....and what a promotion....... I now understand that in addition to the fake news and somehow fashionable now....it must I also expect fake movies. Sure, a director can create wonders with a bad script, together with exceptional actors. What was missing from this film production? The script was written after fabulous books.....books of undisputed worldwide success. The technical team was top notch. Where did it go wrong and who is the sucker in the equation that ruined everything? Remove the special effects from the film and see what you're left with....with nothing that can be compared to the original story...and this idea of Muslim religious fanaticism...this rude reference to images familiar to TV news somehow. ......he wants to be what?

Though the story is likely well known by many now, I will be largely celebrating how well Legendary Pictures adapted the series to the big screens. First off, everything feels as if it was truly recorded right off the camera, and directly ported to the big screen. No moment felt off when the CG. Compare this to the likes of Marvel where CG was so bad, there were commonly viewer complaints with regards of the CG absolutely ruining the immersion for the viewers. The CG in Dune translated the text from the book to the big screen in a near perfect manor. Every scene feels as if the book was being read aloud and with the utmost detail. Dune 2 in text form wasn't exactly the most suitable for the big screen. Without getting into too much graphically, Dune 2 tones down the more explicit scenes greatly while keeping the idea there for the readers to know what had actually gone on. Overall, Dune 2 kept the essence of what readers loved about it, whole exemplifying the experience on the big screen.\n                \n                    0 out of 1 found this helpful.\n                        \n                            Was this review helpful?

They made his wife his enemy, who hates her own people's faith and hope. The emperor was barely developed, it was more about his daughter (no doubt DEI influence here). There was no space folding, or weird creatures. The bad guys were the heroes in this film, they had more words and better characters. It's like the people who did this hate religion, a core part of the story. I am not seeing Dune III. I'm tired of seeing my favorite films re-written without the core parts that made them great films to begin with. I think we need an alternative to the studio system. They love to make money off fan favorites, but hate the films we love, and they work to wreck them, so no one likes them. I used to love movies, now there are no movies to love. If you loved Dune, don't see this film. It's a shadow of the first one. The supernatural stuff and the science fiction technology is stripped from this film. It's a flat version of the original stories. That stuff is what made the film great, now it's just another bad remake.", "rating": 3, "sentiment": 0, "date": "3 March 2024", "name": "Terrence_Lovett"}

I must say that never have I been more blown away by how much a movie delivered above and beyond my expectations.Dune (2021) was already a beautiful movie, so I had a lot of expectations from this one. And did it deliver! Dune: Part Two bears every hallmark of the impeccable touch of Denis Villeneuve, and in my humble opinion, this is probably his best product after Blade Runner 2049 (in some aspects Dune: Part Two even exceeded it).Arguably the better half of the story, the first half builds beautifully upon Paul and Jessica's new lives with the Fremen of Arrakis, and does a great job on showcasing Paul's gradual 'transformation' to Lisan al-Gaib, the messianic figure subject to a prophecy. Initially it is a role he is reluctant to accept (and this is beautifully portrayed by Timothee Chalamet), however, Lady Jessica (played brilliantly by Rebecca Ferguson) - being the ever-scheming Bene Gesserit that she is - spreads the prophecy of Lisan al-Gaib deeper and deeper into the hearts of the Fremen, until it reaches a stage at Paul 'Usul' Atreides becomes a near-revered figure among the Fremen, and his battle-identity of Muad'dib becomes a source of headache for the Harkonnens, at which point the Baron, Vladimir Harkonnen, replaces the control of Arrakis to his utterly psychotic cousin, Feyd-Rautha.Here some words must be spent on Austin Butler's portrayal of Feyd-Rautha, which I believe was the one that most closely matches the book; it was every mannerism of the character has been mastered down to the last detail by Butler. I personally found it the best performance.The 2nd half is a bit lacking in pace. While the general storyline of Paul drinking the Water of Life, becoming the Kwisatz Haderach, and waging a war against the Padishah Emperor Shaddam IV is followed, there are several remarkable departures from the book. Paul and Chani's firstborn child is not even mentioned. Alia Atreides is not as important as she was in the book (but that I am fine with). There is no Thufir Hawat in the final confrontation. But despite all these, the movie shines at every moment.The cherries on top are surely Greig Fraser's cinematography and... of course... the great Hans Zimmer!

Go see the movie or read the 9 and 10 star reviews to find out more if you require a complete and detailed synopsis before you can commit to watching a movie. You can stop reading here.If you read the book and/or saw the movie from the 1980's then you will feel 5 stars or less is appropriate, depending on how disappointed all the negative aspects leave you. For this demographic I will explain why I don't believe it is the best movie ever made as others so excitedly proclaim.1. Made the same time as part 1 but delayed for 2 years because WB wanted massive marketing to sell it. Last 2 part movie I will ever go see in the theater.2. Part 1 was a long, drawn out bore fest for me when I saw it in the theater only to find out that it was only an intro to part 2. I include this because it is, in fact, part of this book and part of the story and part of the total experience.3. Dune Part 2 leaves out main characters, main story arcs and in addition to being a very great disappointment for that reason, would impact any supposed Part 3 of the story in an even more dramatic separation from the books.4. Deception by WB in two ways. First, spreading rumors of a part 3 so people will want to see this one feeling it will be an ongoing franchise like star wars or LOTR. Considering how long it took to release part 2 when it was filmed years ago, expect any part 3 to come out around 2030 or later. Secondly, this movie had 9.8 rating on IMDb before it was even released, with that number cited in numerous professional reviews and TV shows. Don't need a private detective to know they were fake or paid or friends and family of those involved with WB and/or the production. Or is it really the greatest movie ever to be made in the history of Cinema? Lol I understand, they need to recoup 200 million plus another billion in profit.5. For me, its just too long to sit through. I admit I fell asleep during the Part 1 it was so boring. Maybe because I did know the story. Also, the sound was overwhelmingly loud, I was regretting not bringing ear plugs to the theater with me. Don't ever bring a young child to the theater to see this movie as it might damage their hearing.For me its a one star because of the reasons I listed above and the fact that its just another remake anyway, nothing new here. But I realize that for many, spectacular special effects and action on a grandiose scale is what movie watching is all about, and of course it being the GOAT movie and worthy of a 10. (that's probably most of the audience and professional reviewers these days) Some times the story and especially conforming to a book, is irrelevant to the audience, so I split the difference with my rating.My suggestion: if you have MAX then wait until it is released there in a few months.Hopefully you appreciate an honest review with absolutely no detailed synopsis to spoil it for you.", "rating": 6, "sentiment": 1, "date": "3 March 2024", "name": "deathgateminion"}

I can imagine she had to perform looks until Villeneuve was content.The first 1/3 is boring as hell. Boring sand scenes that don't go anywhere.Javier Bardem version Stilgar is unintentional funny.

So far, I like this whole effort better than the David Lynch epic from the 1980's. And I liked that, but it was a snoozer for most folks, unless you had some acquaintance with the novels. I read the first two novels, Dune and Messiah, because that's what sci-fi/fantasy nerds do. You're supposed to read first, watch second, and then complain about the adaptation. I felt like I missed a bunch in the reads because I was sort of expecting Star Wars and ended up stumbling over the religious intricacies and terminology. Not what your average male teen is looking for. Now that I'm much older (56), these are the elements of the story that make it more interesting for me. Watching anime and K-dramas regularly now has made subtitles a normal thing, so I'm not put off by the fact that Villeneuve devoted so much of the dialogue to the Freman language. I found myself intrigued by it and wondered how much of an effort was made to develop it. I also like that Villeneuve elected to make the Freman a much richer culture than just simply a pack of ass-kicking, desert rebels. I'm there for that too, of course, but he needed to do this to make the saga something that could hold interest across multiple movies. This movie also elevates women without spilling over into feminism to do it. This is perhaps because it's coming from a book written in the 1960's. And while Frank Herbert was forward-thinking (as sci-fi authors tend to be), the women in this world are elevated (and equal) because they posess unique, spiritual abilities, not because they're on par physically. Yes, they can fight, but they have to fight to survive, so it's just not a point they keep bringing up and shoving down your throat as a message. Another element to this adding to my satisfaction is the $200 million they've spent to make the the world of Arrakis look real and badass. The dragon-fly aerial ships, the weaponry, those massive spice harvesters. Everything just looks stunning. So why isn't it a 10? Because not enough was done to develop Feyd's rep. To be sure, they quickly established his bona fides as true Harkonnen prick, but he needed to appear much earlier in the narrative and be shown to be a worthy adversary to Paul in more than just gladiatorial contests.", "rating": 9, "sentiment": 1, "date": "13 March 2024", "name": "mrmeach"}

That being said, Dune: Part Two is a visual and audio experience.Denis Villenueve and Hans Zimmer (along with all the other screen and song writers) found a way to make Arrakis a tangible experience. While watching in IMAX I was immersed in the film. If you are an audiophile then this movie will scratch every itch you didn't know you had. The sound effects were masterful, the scene with Paul and the sand worm shook the entire theater.The acting is nothing short of masterful, looking at Timothee Chalamet he gives the vibes of a \"drama kid who just learned to project his voice to the back of the auditorium\". However his performance is nothing short of a spectacle. He commands every scene, especially in the third act. Rebecca Ferguson plays her role so incredibly, and Javier Bardem injects and energy and levity to the movie in a way that doesn't derail the overall seriousness of the movie. Austin Butler looks like he is having the time of his life playing a villain and not in a Jared Leto Joker kind of way.Let's address the haters, some people are very loyal to the source material and Denis Villenueve takes creative liberty when needed. In painting Paul Atreides as a tragic messianic hero rather than a valiant warrior, he also stays truer to Frank Herbert's vision. Yes, there are things that happen in the book that doesn't happen in the movie, there are character changes and plot changes, but I cannot wait to see how those changes drive forward the story with the adaption of Dune Messiah which is Part 3.We have a new generation of actors who are setting the bar incredibly high, and we've seen them in incredible performances in other films. Timothee Chalamet, Austin Butler, Zendaya, and Florence Pugh are giving me hope as the newest generation of actors that care about their performances and bring the gravitas necessary for these incredibly poignant roles.

{"id": 1404, "title": "Great First Half, Second Half Falls Flat", "content": "I liked, but did not love the first movie. I, however, loved the first half of this film. It built on the momentum from the first entry and provided a story which was headlined by the compelling tension between Paul and his mother as to whether or not he truly was the prophet that he was believed to be. Watching Paul slowly become a Fremen also provided some light-hearted interactions which effectively served to break up any sense of monotony. Unfortunately, however, the movie ruined its own intrigue and the second half act fell quite flat for me.Put simply, once the movie confirms that Paul really is the prophet, the internal conflict that was plaguing him throughout the first half of the film, as well as the tension between he and his mother seems to quickly vanish. Moreover, from that point on, the film makes it quite clear that nothing and no one can lay a finger on Paul which meant that every obstacle that he faced from that point on seemed quite trivial and left me wanting to fast forward to part 3. I got to the point, sadly, where I simply didn't care what was going to happen next because I knew that, whatever it was, it wouldn't pose a challenge to the protagonist. The film presents obstacles as mountains, and Paul proceeds to jump over them like mole hills. The best example of this is the introduction of Austin Butler's character (Feyd-Rautha). The film makes us spend a significant amount of time being introduced to, learning about, and building up Feyd-Rautha as a potential foe for Paul all for him to be killed, unceremoniously, just seconds after besting Paul in combat. I'm really not sure how Villeneuve thought that Paul, off-camera, somehow flipping around Feyd-Rautha's knife while he was in the middle of executing him would be a satisfying ending to the character that he spent so much time building up, especially considering the way Austin Butler turned in an incredible performance and stole absolutely every scene he was in.I'm hoping that part 3 re-establishes a sense of jeopardy by making Paul face obstacles which actually provide a challenge because, on the whole, I'm still interested to see how this story comes to an end. I'm just crossing my fingers that I don't have to, once again, spend a significant portion of the film feeling like all the obstacles in Paul's path are nothing more than minor inconveniences.Overall, I'd say that the first half is a 4/5 but the second half is, for me, at most a 2/5.", "rating": 6, "sentiment": 1, "date": "2 March 2024", "name": "spharing"}

The acting is wonderful, the visuals stunning and the soundtrack almost blew me out my seat more than once. I've always had a soft spot for the David Lynch version and there are elements of that movie I would have loved to see here (weirding weapons for instance) grand in scope that it is, the lynch version for me does a better job of showcasing a greater scale and scope of the overall universe albeit in 80s style. I have one or two other minor gripes also, I felt the pacing was off in moments, almost like scenes had been abruptly removed, we seemed to get to big moments in the story just by cut to black in one moment and there the next with no explanation. Also, the villains are sorely under used in my opinion and fail to live up to their name, each meeting their end in a rather underwhelming way. Raban, poor Raban was reduced to a comic villain in the end. Anyway, despite that I loved the movie, it was epic and by far the best thing I have seen in a cinema for many many years. I hope we get to see the conclusion of the trilogy and an end to the what will then be the best movie trilogy of a lifetime.\n                \n                    0 out of 3 found this helpful.\n                        \n                            Was this review helpful?

He knows how to do things that captivate and to make sure he gives a great experience to the audience. I speak for myself when i saw Arrival, Incendies, Blade Runner, Sciario, but the most beautiful one was Arrival and Incendies. I really advice people to start from there before watching Dune.Dune is book that is 50 years old, we had one movie only in 1984 directed by David Lynch but Star Wars came in 1977 and of course blew the charts and it was more marketing and it was already a sucess and left Dune behind and forgotten. No one ever dared to make a Dune movie again. Props to David Lynch for the courage.Never forget that Dune paved the way for Star Wars.Then we have Denis old dream to make Dune one day great again. He drew sketches when he read the books, he fell in love with the storie and wanted and dreamed that one day he would directed Dune and make justice to it.We arrived to 2021, Dune Part I for me it was beautiful and it was Denis dream come true, despite the bad critics from the box offices and the viewers he didin\u00b4t gave up and knew it was just a preparation for something huge and great. The scenarios were so realistic and choosing that Cast was a perfect choice.Now we have Dune Part II in 2024. He does not rush into things.

{"id": 1419, "title": "Are you serious?! 10/10?! You are kidding...", "content": "How the heck are there so many 10/10 reviews for this?! This was a genuinely disappointing experience. But first, the good bits: The audio is amazing and visually stunning. But that is it.The entire finale was inevitable. We are told it is inevitable from the beginning of the movie, so there is no suspense throughout the entire thing. It plays out exactly as expected: Paul is the chosen one. Some believe he is, and others don't. He is great at everything he does on the first try. Everyone is convinced to follow him anyway because he is great at everything. They attack the bad guys, the plan goes great, and Paul wins.We, as the audience, do not feel the same suspense and payoff as the characters. We know Paul is alive, so revealing him to other characters has no effect on us. Also, the other characters, like Princess Irulan and the Bene Gesserit, are just assuming he is alive anyway, so their actions are unaffected by his potential death.Gurney returns, and it is just an \"Ok. He's back. They hug. Now they have Gurney again.\" I am okay not knowing the whole backstory of how he survived, and I don't need to be spoonfed. But we get about a minute of Gurney doing his new thing until he bumps into Paul, and they hug it out. At least Gandalf's return in The Two Towers was fuelled by tension and foreshadowing, and the characters were there for a reason. For this, it was just \"whelp, another Fremen attack.\"Oh, and then Gurney casually mentions they have nukes, too, if they want them. Another thing handed to Paul on a silver platter. Which somehow is controversial for Chani. This brutal guerrilla fighter is suddenly like, \"Oh man, I was all for killing people, but this nuke situation... bad. Don't do it, Paul.\" but then that is it. No more discussion about this atomic arsenal. I don't even know if they used them in the final battle because the effect of the missiles they did use was not particularly atomic...So, while Paul is busy being great at everything but also Jon Snowing it by saying, \"But I don't want it.\" Rabban is having difficulty solving the Fremen problem, so we get introduced to Feyd-Rautha, apparently the Neville Longbottom of the Kwisatz Haderach prophecy. Who we get to see be more psychopathic than his brother and a prime candidate to solve the Fremen problem using his unique skillset of... doing the exact same thing his brother was doing, which is shelling the **** out of the desert. But this time, it just so happens that Feyd-Rautha shelled the correct place, Sietch Tabr. How did he know the right place? No idea. All we see as an audience is him doing the exact same thing his brother did. Great. Maybe show us that Feyd-Rautha is more competent instead of just telling us? Because licking knives and being a psychopath does not mean you are better at outthinking Fremen.So Paul goes south, which he did not want to do because he does not want to be Mr Prophecy Man, but now he has to. So when he gets there, he drinks the Water of Life that kills men but gives women memories of all their female ancestors, and he finds out he is half Harkonnen, which is... important? Why does he do this when he does not believe in the prophecy or want to be involved in it? Who knows. Maybe it is all a ruse. Maybe he does think he is the chosen one and has bluffed his way into being trusted. Sure, it is nice to finish a movie with something to think about, but the entire movie shouldn't be a complete tease with no payoff.Speaking of finishing the movie. The finale is. Paul and the Fremen bait out the emperor. They set a \"trap\" and the \"trap\" is... jump out of the sand and charge. Great. Really using the Fremen advantage here. The fight could have been so clever, but instead, it was an artillery strike, then a charge. Christ...So Paul walks into the throne room, kills Grandfather Baron Harkonnen, and challenges the emperor to single combat (which is just so tiresome to see these days). Feyd-Rautha volunteers to represent the emperor. So Paul and Feyd-Rautha try to knife each other. Feyd-Rautha stabs Paul! But wait! Paul wins! Because... he stabs Feyd-Rautha. So I guess Paul's stab was better than Feyd-Rautha's... Okay. So, the new bad guy with zero character development is dead.It wasn't a terrible movie. It was just unfulfilling. It was beautiful both visually and audibly. But the pacing was terrible; we had too much detail for meaningless sections and not enough for others.

{"id": 1420, "title": "Amazing adaptation, despite some flaws in pacing.", "content": "Beautifully filmed, powerfully acted, elegantly scored and well written. As a film, Dune Part 2 almost ticks all the boxes. In my opinion, the only struggle this film suffered, was its pacing towards the middle of the film. Here, the story focuses a lot on developing Paul Atreides character, which is of course necessary, but it does so in a manner that doesn't feel structured enough, especially for those who might not have read the book. As the film nears the third act, it picks up the pace, which leads to an action packed finale with great battle sequences (that for some reason feel a bit too short).Having read the book, Villeneuve faced a very difficult task in bringing the second part of the book to life, as this is the part that is driven by character thoughts and feelings the most. Of course, some things from the book were changed or cut entirely, but I think Villeneuve did a very good job with this. Admittedly, there were a few characters or sequences that I was hoping to see, but that would've blown the already massive runtime out of proportion.All I can say is that this film needs to be seen at least a few times, especially for people who have not read the book, as the film features very abstract and complex ideas that are easily missed or misunderstood. Once those ideas and concepts are clear to the viewer, it is obvious that Villeneuve definitely did the story of Dune justice with this beautiful and at times mesmerizing film.", "rating": 9, "sentiment": 1, "date": "5 March 2024", "name": "mathiasandersen-75719"}

Building upon the intricate world-building and character development established in the first installment, \"Dune: Part Two\" delves even deeper into the complex politics, rich mythology, and existential themes that define Herbert's universe.Visually breathtaking and intellectually stimulating, the film immerses viewers once again in the harsh yet mesmerizing landscapes of Arrakis, brought to life with awe-inspiring cinematography and meticulous attention to detail. From the vast deserts to the towering sandworms, every frame feels like a work of art, elevating the epic scope of the story.The ensemble cast delivers outstanding performances across the board, with Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet reprising his role as the conflicted hero Paul Atreides with captivating intensity. Zendaya shines as the enigmatic Chani, while Oscar Isaac brings gravitas to the role of Duke Leto Atreides. New additions to the cast, including Javier Bardem as Stilgar and Rebecca Ferguson as Lady Jessica, further enrich the tapestry of characters, each adding depth and complexity to the narrative.One of the film's greatest strengths lies in its exploration of power, identity, and destiny. As Paul grapples with his newfound abilities and the weight of his prophesied role as the Kwisatz Haderach, the film delves into themes of agency, sacrifice, and the consequences of wielding immense power. Villeneuve deftly navigates these weighty themes, crafting a story that is both thought-provoking and emotionally resonant.Furthermore, \"Dune: Part Two\" maintains a brisk pace despite its lengthy runtime, keeping audiences engaged with its riveting plot twists and visceral action sequences. The film strikes a perfect balance between spectacle and substance, offering both heart-pounding thrills and moments of quiet introspection.While \"Dune: Part Two\" may not provide all the answers or neatly tie up every narrative thread, it sets the stage for an epic conclusion that is sure to leave audiences eagerly anticipating the final installment. With its stunning visuals, compelling performances, and thought-provoking themes, \"Dune: Part Two\" solidifies Villeneuve's adaptation as a modern sci-fi masterpiece.", "rating": 6, "sentiment": 1, "date": "10 March 2024", "name": "aerotechtime"}

Imagine sitting through a cosmic mass where the hymns are replaced with sand, sand, and more sand, and the messiah wears a stillsuit rather than robes. It's as if the filmmakers decided that what today's audiences really need is a hefty dose of desert spirituality, served on a platter of special effects with a side of prophetic mumbo-jumbo. The result? A cinematic pilgrimage that might just have you praying for an intermission. So, grab your popcorn and prepare to ascend to the highest peak of sci-fi solemnity, where the only thing deeper than the themes is the sand you'll be digging out of your shoes for weeks.\n                \n                    43 out of 204 found this helpful.\n                        \n                            Was this review helpful?

The one huge glaring and unforgivable change they made was with Chani. Zendaya's depiction of her is atrocious, probably because she only knows how to play an angry don't-need-no-man teenage girl.

I know many writing reviews here have no connection to the book so missed most of the nuisances so I get why you might give it a high rating for its artistic stylings. But what is so wrong with being faithful to the book. The reason the book was so successful over the tens of thousands of other sci fi books out there is because of the specifics of the story, characters, themes and writing. So why mess with that? It's a question that has obvious answers. Political correctness and personal whim. But both of these seem crazy given the story already had plenty of positives and potentialities without having to change it. The alterations to Chani's character are unforgivable. They turned her into a petulant 21st teenager. Inconceivable. Strong female characters fill the pages of Dune (and many sci fi classics). It seems film makers think they need to be turned into cartoon characters in order to be strong in the current era. Could keep going but essentially just really disappointed after the first chapter.

There are the lengthy static shots; instead of rhythm, a loud roar accompanies every scene that is supposed to have a dramatic effect. Sometimes less would have been more, Mr. Zimmer. It's as if the movie is selling the audience for fools, as if the projectionist turns up the volume a few decibels every other scene so that no one misses the great drama unfolding on the screen. Because the images are only sometimes able to tell the story. Certainly, the ride on the sandworm and the first raid on a Spice harvester fill the entire movie theater. Similarly, some characters such as Rebecca Fergurson or Austin Butler can certainly arouse interest with their mysterious nature. But then again, the story is too one-dimensional, the religious element is only scratched on the surface and the fight against the Harkonnen ultimately dissolves into a dune chase against Nazis.

{"id": 1433, "title": "Better than part one", "content": "The sequel to Dune (2021), titled Dune: Part Two, is an epic science fiction film based on the novel by Frank Herbert.

In the previous film, House Harkonnen decimated House Atreides and assassinated Paul's father, Duke Leto Atreides.Personally, I have a preference for Dune: Part Two over its predecessor. By the time I viewed the second movie, I had gathered more information and explored the Dune saga more thoroughly, enabling a deeper understanding and appreciation of the film. The cinematography is breathtaking, with several panoramic scenes being notably remarkable. The portrayal of the desert planet is done with incredible quality, which stood out to me as particularly impressive. However, I find the film's narrative structure to pose a challenge due to its intricate plot.

{"id": 1436, "title": "Satisfying for book readers, woefully underexplained for everyone else", "content": "As someone who's read through God Emperor of Dune (and part of Chapterhouse), I really enjoyed seeing the story brought to life, and for the most part the movie was very satisfying. However, I think it does a criminally terrible job of explaining the actual plot, not to mention doing absolutely no legwork to re-establish very important facts from the first movie.The latter is a symptom of this single movie being split into two. If this were one very long movie, it would be forgivable (but still probably bad storytelling) to never mention why spice is important in the last half, but if you're going to split it into two movies and even claim that the second one is watchable without seeing the first, there are some bare minimum concessions to basic exposition that must be made.However, the bigger problems are with the apparent intent to stretch this into 3, 4, or more movies. I read an article where the director says that the movie ends how Dune ends... which is somewhat true, they end at the same point in the narrative. The massive difference is that Dune as a book stands on its own. If you want to continue the story, there's an excellent grand arc stretching through God Emperor, but at the end of the first book the reader has a very good idea of where the story is going, what Paul's visions entail, why he's conflicted, how he intends to conduct an asymmetrical war against literally the whole galaxy, and the status of several other important schemes.At the end of the movie, we know that Paul had some sort of vision, that he's starting some sort of war (how?) and that he and Chani are fighting.This, to me, reeks of sequel-bait. The vision itself is the most infuriating part -- I was literally waiting for the entire first movie and the first half of this one for that scene, and they give you literally nothing but a teaser for the next film. This is the part that sucks even as a book reader, because that scene should have been beautiful and terrifying and awe-inspiring... instead it was just boring.I'm glad I watched the movie, but only because it offered a creative and bombastic visual expression of a book that I love. As a companion piece to the book, I'd give it an 8/10 -- a great visual adaptation narratively harmed by the excision of critical material. But as a standalone movie I can't forgive the swiss-cheese plot which doesn't do enough work to explain its extremely complicated world.", "rating": 6, "sentiment": 1, "date": "11 March 2024", "name": "aldrenean"}

To start with, and that's probably the (my) problem, I'm a Lynch (never really liked his Dune movie though), Kubrick, Nolan movie nerd.

Yes, far more advanced and visuals, sound design, score made to perfection (hence the 6-star rating) BUT the story and its execution on film is a huge disappointment! Close to 3 hours (and I love long movies) of annoying love story (we saw that coming in Part One), worm riding(!!), Paul-frowning/hesitation, repetitious and lame dialogues, some Action sequences to keep the audience awake and a climax which isn't interesting and leads to nowhere. As always I felt like a director wants to make a sequel, desperately tries to top the first installment, puts in the whole nine yards (bigger, louder, longer) and is very (too) considered to make sure it reaches the biggest audience possible to guarantee a box office hit ...but forgets to tell an interesting story. Gone is the originality, authenticity, creativity and new approach which made me fall in love with a movie which is different and genuine.

Firstly, the characters are underdeveloped. You don't understand their motivations or thinking process. For example, you knew all along that Paul would drink the water of life. What it's unclear is why this was so important, where this idea came from and ultimately what led Paul to rethink his skepticism and drink it. The scene of the desert spring tear is just ridiculous.The technology itself is also used as a plot device and the way ot works changes according to the needs of the scene. On one scene the two main characters are hiding underneath a spice harvester to use an archaic RPG to destroy a small ornithopter. As soon as they do, some dude comes out from hiding and uses a big ass laser to instantaneously destroy the much larger harvester. Then why not use the laser on the ornithopter first then? The shields, that in the first movie effectively stopped knifes unless you entered slow and steady, seem according to the scene to either be efficient or not work at all, with fast blows being fatal at the first atempt despite the opponent's shield being on.This type of viewer dumbification, or the idea that viewers will take whatever nonsense you throw at them, is part of the reason why sci-fi now is all about visuals and choreography and not about content.

I didn't come away disappointed, but I wasn't thrilled either. Denis Villeneuve undoubtedly understands his craft, but at the same time, the film doesn't bring anything explicitly new creatively. You have to take into account that the literary source material is just great, and it's largely what makes the film good. Creatively and visually, the film doesn't bring anything truly new to the table. It doesn't create a new visual image like Star Wars or the original take on Dune. If Villeneuve, with his craft, had the artistic approach of Jodorowsky then only a memorable work would have been created. Personally, I also have reservations about the leads. Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet is excellent as the young Paul Atreides but for me he lacks the charisma of the leader Muad'Dib, Zendaya traditionally performs rather lacklustrely. Austin Butler as Feyd-Rautha, on the other hand, impressed me.\n                \n                    2 out of 5 found this helpful.\n                        \n                            Was this review helpful?

I suppose the tech was there, but if you are going to remake Dune, in any form, well, it's one of Science Fiction's masterpieces, with countless of millions of fans globally, and we are critical when you mess with 'our stuff'. Arrakis was more than desert, with some locals running around. It was the singular Key Planet in all of the universe, after all, because of the Worm and Spice.It's an incredibly complex tale of a future vision of humanity evolved and a challenge for any movie adaptation. It needs a good, multi-seasonal, series, like Games of Thrones, where all of this can be served up in proper detail.The 1984 film was better, the 2000 TV-series was better, this doesn't come close to those, and not at all close to the works of Herbert.None of the characters represented, Paul least of all. You'd expect the heir of a Great House, battle-trained since birth, tormented by visions he doesn't understand, to be a little more meaty and introspective, burdened with duty and responsibility, befitting his role in the universe, especially after his father was murdered. And when he accepted his fate, to be more convincing of it. Bad script? Bad acting? Didn't work for me. Others were almost believable, the Emperor of the Universe was a joke. None communicated the gravity of their positions.I think if you're going to have a major role in such a movie, you should read the books! At least get an idea of who you need to portray.As others have said, many key issues and sequences from the book were completely absent. To name a few; the relationship between the Bene Gesserit, their breeding program, the Harkonnen and Atreides, Kanly, the absolute uniqueness and importance of Spice, the Guild, Bene Tleilax ... the list is long.With six hours available I'd think a better job could've been done. Villeneuve should learn from Jackson, who turned a 134-page book (the Hobbit) into a great 3-film epic (and of course LOTR itself).Anyone disappointed with these two films, please, please, do read the books instead, watch the 1984 extended film, and the TV series.Forget this.", "rating": 1, "sentiment": 0, "date": "7 March 2024", "name": "rickvivela"}

Building upon the intricate world-building and character development established in the first installment, \"Dune: Part Two\" delves even deeper into the complex politics, rich mythology, and existential themes that define Herbert's universe.Visually breathtaking and intellectually stimulating, the film immerses viewers once again in the harsh yet mesmerizing landscapes of Arrakis, brought to life with awe-inspiring cinematography and meticulous attention to detail. From the vast deserts to the towering sandworms, every frame feels like a work of art, elevating the epic scope of the story.The ensemble cast delivers outstanding performances across the board, with Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet reprising his role as the conflicted hero Paul Atreides with captivating intensity. Zendaya shines as the enigmatic Chani, while Oscar Isaac brings gravitas to the role of Duke Leto Atreides. New additions to the cast, including Javier Bardem as Stilgar and Rebecca Ferguson as Lady Jessica, further enrich the tapestry of characters, each adding depth and complexity to the narrative.One of the film's greatest strengths lies in its exploration of power, identity, and destiny. As Paul grapples with his newfound abilities and the weight of his prophesied role as the Kwisatz Haderach, the film delves into themes of agency, sacrifice, and the consequences of wielding immense power. Villeneuve deftly navigates these weighty themes, crafting a story that is both thought-provoking and emotionally resonant.Furthermore, \"Dune: Part Two\" maintains a brisk pace despite its lengthy runtime, keeping audiences engaged with its riveting plot twists and visceral action sequences.

Which always put at rest my lore obsessed brain because it all made sense, I could tell from the beginning that both parts were crafted by people who understood and cared about the source material without approaching it like some sort of sacred text. On that note I was quite surprised and pleased by the changes they did with characters, timeline and most specifically the ending, which only left me wanting more.Despite the fact that unfortunately my local cinema doesn't have imax screens the experience was an absolute blast and I was nothing short of euphoric with a stupid grin the entire movie it felt surreal and overwhelming at times taking it all in. I loved how it expanded from the themes established in the first one, particularly the detailed exploration of Fremen culture, how ominous and mysterious felt the Bene Gesserit, as for the Harkonnens besides the obvious praise for how brutal, weird and cool they're portrayed I particularly appreciated the H. R Giger inspired look of their Black Sun lit Giedi Prime. All while staying true to the essence of the story.With a chunky and lengthy runtime its impossible for me to pinpoint favorite moments. My jaw dropped at the sheer scale of many sequences, namely the opening scene with the orange hues and the levitating Harkonnens, also the gladiator scene, the big Feyd-Rautha entrance was bonkers the fighting choreography felt natural and realistic and well thought out, tho I gotta admit I was iffy at first but ultimately pleasantly surprised by Austin's Feyd-Rautha.Overall, the performances, direction, music, sound design, cinematography, and production design were outstanding. The themes of fanaticism and the difficulty of reasoning with true believers resonated deeply with me. Plus, getting to watch it with three of my favorite people made the movie watching experience even more lovely.

The movie oscillates between grandeur and patheticness. While at one point the director succeeds in staging something of philosophical greatness, the high flight repeatedly ends at low points such as the completely one-dimensional good-evil characterization.

Dune 2 gives us everything from character development, to some pretty sick action and a lot of meaningful moments between characters.

A line of underwhelming dialog accompanied by a flourish of loud music does not make it earth shaking, but that's what this movie relies on much of the time. It also spends a lot of time on ambiguous imagery or hallucinations, which in my opinion are not done well. Another gripe I have is Paul's love interest, Chani, played by Zendaya. Her behavior make no sense. At first she is the only one of the Freemen who accepts Paul, and everyone else mistrusts him. But then after everyone else finally accepts him, she becomes a hostile, difficult pain in the butt for no reason. And they give her a lot of screen time just for her hostility and antagonism. And that leads me to my final gripe over the movie, which is that they tried to impart some weakness or fragility into Paul's character. In the book and in the earlier versions, Paul is as cool as a cucumber. In this movie he loses his temper and shouts at his mother, whimpers after his girlfriend, and even gets stabbed by the Harkonen. It also ends on a cliffhanger, where a big spaceship battle is about to happen, so I guess we are all supposed to see part 3.

One of the biggest ones, is the education system. There appears to be many roles you can study for, such as becoming a human computer, or a bene gesserit, which are all different schools that transform people completely, although this is only briefly touched upon in the movies and could easily be missed.The countless details in the movie, which have an unmentioned background: the black and white scene on the planet of Harkonnen, which is because of their moons and suns; the whole process of becoming a reverend mother and the comparison between houses; the whole house of the emperor and their planet has barely been touched.

{"id": 1505, "title": "Too different from the book", "content": "Dune Part 2 missed the mark for me. While it is visually appealing, it lacks the narrative depth and intrigue present in the novel. The book presents a complex web of plots and machinations interwoven into one story; the movie is more akin to other sci fi spectacles, and leans into an action movie vibe, which tonally doesn't work with the source material. It's like it's trying to be both things at the same time, and as a result accomplishes neither.Many of the character arcs and storylines present in the novel are either heavily altered, or missing entirely. Naturally, a decent amount of this is to be expected whenever a narrative work is converted to film, but with Denis Villeneuve's Dune 2, the the changes are as numerous as they are baffling. Alia is never born in the film, and she doesn't kill the Baron. Paul does? (and the Emperor?) The introduction of Alia was perfect in book, and helps to revitalize the progression of events, keeping the story gripping and thought provoking. The movie on the other hand, spends an extortionate amount of time explaining the water of life, and exploring Jessica's new role as a Reverend Mother.In summary, Dune Part 2 is a visually appealing, narratively lacking, cinematic experience, which is refreshing when contrasted with many other recent films. Those that are new to the dune universe will likely be somewhat entertained, whereas fans of the books will probably be frustrated at the various alterations and changes.", "rating": 6, "sentiment": 1, "date": "2 March 2024", "name": "southrnboy-76590"}

For a film this long, you do not feel the time go by. At the end of the film, however, I was left unfulfilled, missing something that I could not exactly point to. This is a good result I think for Villeneuve as I am a big Dune fan.Now, it is the following day, and I realise that the timeline within the first two films (and I am not quite sure if I will be pleased with anymore as Dune 3 is planned) is less than a year. Guerrilla warfare is supposed to be used in order for Paul to learn Arrakis and the Freemen, and this kind of war takes time to have any impact. And then everything is condensed and transformed from the book.I was looking forward to a full and complete treatment of the novel, or at least as near to it as possible, and the supranatural treatment of the Paul character changed too much the feeling of the original book character. So many others, and very difficult to visualise, concepts have been very well dealt with that it is difficult to see why the original story have not been more respected.A note of 7 is still a very good note as you spend a good time, but it is not like Ghostbusters (1984) where you were exiting the cinema joyfully and excited at the time, in a good mood and contented. Something is still missing and nagging about the whole storyline.

{"id": 1512, "title": "Not a Masterpiece. Not LOTR. Not Star Wars. Still an AMAZING Story.", "content": "I wanna start out by saying this movie is an AMAZING story portrayed through the medium of film. It's a 10/10 for the sci-fi element, and it's a 10/10 for the adapted story. Unfortunately, it's probably a 5/10 for the execution, and a 7/10 for the acting.The pacing of this movie is what really disappointed me. The first movie went boom, boom, boom in order. You knew what was happening in real time, because everything was maybe a day apart at most. In this movie, some scenes feel like MONTHS apart with no explanation in between. In one scene, I legitimately went, \"Wait, what?\" because it had skipped so far ahead in the timeline. The last 45 minutes felt especially RUSHED. When I think about it now, they honestly could have put the first 1/3 of this movie at the end of the first movie, and it would made more sense. Then they could have spent more time in this movie to slow down the pace and piece the story more efficiently. So yeah, pacing was not great feature in this film.Now when it comes to the acting, I want to preface this by saying that Timothee and Zendaya are GREAT performers in general. When it came to this movie though, not a lot of depth and development. The pacing is kinda the problem here too. They're not given the time to \"fill their shoes\". You see a glimpse of character development. When do you see it, though? You guessed it. The last 45 minutes of the movie. Before then, mostly the same characters from the first movie. Nice intimate scenes with each other, but nothing of real depth and internal conflict like you would expect in a story like this. Javier Bardem, Rebecca Ferguson, and Austin Butler were amazing in this film. Lea Seydoux was an utter waste of time and not relevant to the film. Florence Pugh was kinda pointless too. Her relevance is more in important to, you guessed it, the last 45 minutes of the movie. They probably could have picked a better actress just because she doesn't really come across as someone who can portray royalty, in my opinion. I can tell she's in the limelight at the present moment, so it is what it is. Christopher Walken was not a perfect fit for the emperor, but I love him, and he deserves to be in big budget films at his age. You'll get what I mean when you watch the movie, though. Christopher Walken is CHRISTOPHER WALKEN no matter what movie you put him in.I write this just to inform people to not go into this film thinking that it is the second coming of LOTR or Star Wars. It is it's own movie, and time will tell if it will be counted among the greats. Is it a great movie? ABSOLUTELY. Is it one of the greatest? Maybe? IMDB top 100? Sure.

But in Dune 2 everything is all plain to see and has already been explained.

The biggest letdown of them all was a very bland Feyd-Rautha (Butler) who is by far the worst acted character - he could've been much more interesting...I understand that Villeneuve had pressure on him to keep up the pace of the movie and most importantly build the arc of Paul but I feel he could have done much more to create the depth that Dune was so full of.Therefore I only grant this epic an 8/10 which should tell you that it still is, in spite of it's flaws, one of the best movies of a decade, but not the best ;).", "rating": 8, "sentiment": 1, "date": "29 February 2024", "name": "addeman_25"}

Zero of that happens on Dune2. The last fight was equally abrupt, Gurney kills Rabban in 5 seconds.

{"id": 1527, "title": "OKish, but Dune fans will find this very problematic", "content": "Dune Part Two is, unfortunately, nothing more than an above-average contemporary Hollywood movie. Above-average because, just like the first part, it looks great and is a fantastic visual experience. It is a typical Hollywood movie because the plot is very, very thin, verging too many times on the ridiculous. I say this as a huge fan of the novels: Villeneuve & Co. Have made a pretty big mess of this -- just to be clear, it is not a problem that it diverges from Herbert, but that everything is just very crude. Contrary to the first part (which was superior in all respects, including visuals), part two takes significant liberties in changing Herbert's story, mostly by making characters and storylines super one-sided and stereotypical. Dune fans will find it appalling that Stilgar is turned into this stupid, child-like, religious \"fundamentalist\". Chani''s character likewise makes zero sense -- Villeneuvian feminism is generally very good (Sicario is brilliant from this point of view), but it is very crudely executed here. Jessica suddenly becomes a die-hard \"propagandist\". The Baron looks and behaves like a helpless pawn and so on, and so on. Very strangely, most of this is impossible to predict by looking at the first movie, which sticks close to the book (Stilgar, Jessica, the Baron are almost entirely different characters here). By far the worst thing is the turning of (most of) the fremen into religious \"fundamentalists\" (as they are repeatedly referred to), which the main characters speak of exactly like this: a kind-of-stupid mass of people that can be manipulated very easily (in the final attack, Paul tells the other main characters that he will just go around and attack \"with the fundamentalists\" -- crazy, for anyone who has read Dune). This is very, very, very bad and completely opposed to Herbert's writing. Of course, it is probably easily understood and accepted by what marketing departments believe are the film's main audiences (similar to Nolan's third Batman installment, it absolutely needlessly pays huge tribute to some of the worst of today's political stereotypes). The major weaknesses of the first film are there: sloppy acting (yes, the hugely over-the-top acting from this stellar cast is still there + why we need the likes of Anya Taylor Joy in a 10-second cameo is also probably explained primarily by marketing departments and not by directorial choice) and editing choices (the part where Paul drinks the water of life and the final battle are perfect examples). Last but not least, the ending is a catastrophe: leaving aside that they needlessly change crucial details apparently to secure plot continuity for a potential sequel, the movie ends with an extremely badly executed cliffhanger that seems to say \"Make sure you tune in next week to watch the third episode\". Overall, this seems way too money-driven and is exactly what Villeneuve promised not to do (oh, I forgot to mention the stupid jokes -- poor Stilgar -- that remind one of Jar Jar Binks). Such a shame, especially since Villeneuve showed with Blade Runner 2049 what he is capable of. Even maintaining the level of Part One would have been much better than this.", "rating": 5, "sentiment": 1, "date": "4 March 2024", "name": "stefanguga"}

George Lucas was wise enough to water it down and pre-market it in a package that appealed to children of all ages: \"Star Wars\" (1977).Denis Villeneuve's first installment, shot 3 years earlier, was a decent 80/100 movie that largely succeeded in paralleling the main plot of the novel.In Part 2, Paul Atreides follows the path opened to him by the Bene Gesserit priestesses through centuries of meticulous artificial selection, genetic - social - racial - religious engineering and becomes the messiah king of the Fremen under the name Muad'Dib, riding giant worms to lead a jihad against the House of Harkonen and the Padishah Emperor Shaddam IV.Herbert wrote a planetary engineering manual that would guide the people who, perhaps hundreds of years later, would make distant planets habitable. Does the movie do him justice? It doesn't.This (Part 2) is a slightly above average audiovisual adaptation of the pulp of that masterpiece. Even though it is the part where the knot is untied, it is far behind the first movie. It has strayed too far - and badly - from the source material. Feyd-Rautha struck me as ridiculous, not creepy. They made a monkey out of Chani's character. The final battle and duel are poorly planned. 1984's \"Dune\" is better than this.We did a rodeo on the seats during the worm riding scenes in the 4DX theater, I clung to the seat like an octopus to avoid falling :)) Watch it at home on your comfortable couch after a few months.

The political intrigue and power dynamics unfold in a compelling manner, keeping viewers engaged throughout the epic journey.

Perhaps that is the central idea of this film in which the prophecies (false or not) come true in favor of Paul-many-more-names, but partly directed by his mother.The narrative picks up where Duna: Part One left off after Paul Atreides is rescued along with his mother, Jessica, by the Fremen. Guided by the visions he has had, he knows he must fight alongside them to defend their planet, while Jessica is convinced she can become leader of the Bene Gesserit to lead Paul to become THE leader by taking advantage of the religious beliefs of the people.The second part of Dune has too much story in a script that couldn't take me by the hand through the film. I was lost in the passage of time. I was constantly thinking, how long has it been? Have they advanced days, weeks or months? Suddenly he is the leader, but he barely passed the first test. Have they already reached the south and left immediately? I think Denis Villeneuve and Jon Spaihts created a not-so-clear script derived from an immense amount of story they wanted to portray.The soundtrack by the great Hans Zimmer is a delight, mixing symphonic and electronic elements that are in keeping with the film's retrofuturistic touch. The sound editing of Richard King? Is a huge success, which complements very well with the music in the moments of battles and training (which are many). In these same scenes, the sound mix of Gareth John? Manages to immerse us in the setting of the scenes with the echoes of the rooms and the wind whipping the sand in the desert.Another of the achievements of Dune: Part Two is the editing by Joe Walker that unites the images in a very successful way to immerse us in the altered perception of the visions, as well as the trepidation of the battles. Greig Fraser's photography in the visions is also beautiful, added to the very close-ups on the characters' faces in moments of tension that capture the looks and gestures that cannot go unnoticed, in addition to the play of colors that goes from black and white to earth tone saturation, depending on characters and locations on screen.The visual effects are good, too, although here I feel like they stumble a bit with Patrice Vermette's production design, which feels very wooden on Zsuzsanna Sipos and Shane Vieau's sets. Yes, there are several moments when I didn't see the cities, I saw the models of the cities.The costume design by multi-nominee Jacqueline West was also not as striking as it could have been. Retrofuturistic films always have that creative freedom for costumes with the possibility of imagining without limits.The cast is good.

The title \"Dune\" needs to be removed from the movies because any similarity with the original book or the other two adaptations is purely coincidental.\n                \n                    0 out of 0 found this helpful.\n                        \n                            Was this review helpful?

{"id": 1550, "title": "A Cinematic Marvel with Room for Improvement\"", "content": "\"Dune 2 is undeniably a cinematic masterpiece, earning its place among the best of the year. The storyline, performances, and score are exceptional, making it a must-see on IMAX. Each character is expertly crafted with a balance of emotion and maturity, captivating audiences. Director Denis Villeneuve's vision shines through, delivering a timeless film.However, there are a few areas for improvement. Firstly, the portrayal of the emperor feels lacking in strength and authority, possibly due to casting choices. Secondly, the final battle scene leans too heavily in favor of one side, neglecting the opportunity to showcase the opposing forces' military prowess. Thirdly, while the build-up to the Feyd-Rautha arena fight is impressive, the actual confrontation falls short, lacking intensity. Lastly, while Timothy's performance is commendable, some of us viewers may have preferred a slightly more physically bulkier portrayal of the messiah/ emperor.Nevertheless, Dune 2 remains a marvel of cinema.\"", "rating": 8, "sentiment": 1, "date": "10 March 2024", "name": "gautamk85"}

I'd be damned if visuals and sound won't win the Oscars.It stays mostly true to the novel. It's been a few years since I've read it but i didn't find stark differences.There's an ample scope for all the lead cast and everyone did a fantastic job. Timothee Chalamet as Paul Artreidis and Zendaya as Chani had a terrific screen presence.A must watch.At times I felt that it was an Indian Film due to the screenplay and action sequences.8.5 stars.", "rating": 8, "sentiment": 1, "date": "2 March 2024", "name": "krishnaharish-k"}
{"id": 1552, "title": "Ok. But where is the music?!", "content": "First I want to address the majority of \"Ones\" I have read here:This story is an adaptation. And most complaints I have seen here can be said for the book as well.Adaptation - Good:\nCharacters ware cut completely, somewhat disappointing, but I can understand why, nothing important lostThe timeline was sped up significantly and that is also understandable.Turning all that inner monologue into actual dialogue? They did an okay job, I'm not sure if it could've been done better. Then again, I'm no screenwriter.The ending got a bit of a makeover, especially with who bites the dust and how. Honestly, it worked better than in the books. Tied up a few character's arcs nicely, a good choice for movie.The only thing that was poorly depicted and I had to explain to some who had not read the books - is the visions and predictions and how there was a lot of different paths for Paul and they are ware form bad to worse.Basically he only had a handful of lesser evils to choose, and not one choice was easy.I think that that was major miss for the story.Acting - Very Good:\nCan't fault the acting, really. Everyone played their parts well, taking in consideration I don't personally like some of the actors.Visuals and cinematography - Very Very Good:\nWhat you see in the trailer you can expect trough the whole movie, the best part from this thing!Music - What Happened?For the half of its duration this movie was musicless. It was lacking even ambient sounds.On couple occasions it got awkward sitting in the theater! You could here people breathe.It baffles me for a day now.Nolan wont let you here dialog properly because of music. And Villeneuve wants you to feel like it is an audiobook? What is going on?Everyone that gave it one and said they fell a sleep I believe them.Nothing justifies this lack of music and sound.", "rating": 7, "sentiment": 1, "date": "4 March 2024", "name": "bzbot"}
{"id": 1553, "title": "Meh", "content": "It wasn't a bad movie... but I would rather have the 1.5 hours of sleep I missed. Part 1 totally blew me away so I had admittedly high expectations. Most sequels are a letdown and this one didn't disappoint in that regard. Some aspects felt forced and otherwise it just didn't have the same magic at part one. I really think part 1 is one of the great sci-fi movies right there with 2001 and Blade Runner. Just like the Lord of the rings trilogy this is going to be a situation where the first one gets watched over and over again and the sequel languishes.I just can't understand all the folks giving it a ten.

Twisted sexual plots mixed with witchcraft and demonology of the most severe kind. If you don't want to be exposed to that, stay away. Very disappointed compared to the first one. It definitely has a message that speaks of religious themes of death and resurrection, messianic overtones, cultic following, demon possession, all by the so called good side as well as the bad. Wanton killing with knives is full on, in a way that is seemingly more sinister than any pg13 movie I've ever scene. It will follow you around for awhile, maybe even keep you up at night.

Left after 1 hour and 30 mins. This is something I have truly never done before in my life, yeah I've fell asleep in the cinema before, but to actually get up and leave.(work night). Don't care how great people are going to say the last part of the movie was (wont believe you anyway), because it really was that bad and it would never make up for the opening 90 minutes. Paid \u00a315 at cinema for this spectacle, save your money people. Its safe to say if this is what people deem a 10/10 masterpiece , I won't be back at the cinema for a long time. Nothing against acting or actors. Storyline/storytelling was garbage.

Without him, we're lost.\"\nIt's pretty much all there, minus the deplorable rave scene (thank you M. Villeneuve).A hero that is not clear if he is The One fights for freedom with the help of his tough lady guided by a truly believer of the prophecy and a quite good Oracle. That is just fine for me.From part One, for me, all Harkonnens and their minions were simply psychopaths. Not in this one. Commandants are soft, get killed by their bosses for any minor misstep (Vader?) too much afraid of their masters and you can't find a good henchman for the service of manslaughter. No doubt the Harkonnens will fall, they employ the most useless 9-5 chaps they could get.The film is, as usual, visually impressive, but also fast-paced.Unfortunately, we will have to wait some couple of years to figure out where it is heading.", "rating": 7, "sentiment": 1, "date": "4 March 2024", "name": "ccleao"}
